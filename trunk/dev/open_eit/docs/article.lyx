Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a tomographic imaging technique
 that makes use of electrical currents injected into a body and of the resulting
 potential field to calculate the spatial distribution of electrical impedance.
 This technique showed promising results in various fields of application
 like earth science, industrial process monitoring and medical imaging.
 In medical imaging the most promising application is lung function monitoring
 to prevent ventilator-induced acute lung injury.
 In this area, EIT covers the need for a cost-effective, ionizing-radiation-free
 and compact monitoring solution.
 As showed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "adler2012"

\end_inset

, EIT has witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of studies over the
 last decade.
 Outside academia, commercial interest also increases: the first commercial
 medical-grade EIT instrument addressing ICU market, PulmoVista 500 (Dräger
 Medical, Lübeck, Germany), has been brought to the market in 2011.
 The downside of worldwide distributed research is that every group has
 defined their own standards.
 This is especially true for data storage.
 Among the multitude of today’s research and commercial EIT devices, none
 share a file format.
 An early attempt to define a file format was made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Record_RiuCosta_1992"

\end_inset

, but was not taken up by the community.
 Twenty years later we feel it is the right time for the community to commit
 to a common data storage solution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea is to make use of a ZIP-based archive to store the several
 folders and files into a single .oeit file, see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:File-architecture"

\end_inset

.
 A similar approach is used to store OpenOffice documents.
 Moreover, the ZIP format is well defined and even recognized by the Internation
al Organization for Standardization (ISO), see ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 N 1621.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

version.txt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file contains version number used to select the corresponding OEIT file
 parser.
 Thus the possibility is provided to add more features to the format in
 future version.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

header
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folder contains file invariant information such: subject description, manufactu
rer and model of the EIT instrument.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

raw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folder can be used so store proprietary-formatted data.
 The way information is stored in the raw folder is up to the manufacturer
 to decide.
 But it is worth noting that OEIT file which only provide raw data will
 not be considered as a valid OEIT-formated file.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folder stores manufacturer-independent data.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

optional data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folder stores miscellaneous information such: print screens and user comments.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

auxiliarynn
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 folder contains data stream which are acquired at a different rate compared
 to the EIT data.
 For example ECG or other information can be stored here provided they do
 not share the same sampling rate (or an integer multiple) as the EIT device.
 Auxiliary folder are limited to 100 starting with auxiliary00 up to auxiliary99.

\begin_layout Subsection
Specification requirement for OEIT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic idea when we started this project was to design a file format
 which could be accommodated to the need of the EIT community in broad meaning.
 This includes the applications and there respective hardware within the
 field of geophysics, mining, agriculture, archeology, industrial process
 and medicine.
 Therefor the developed file format should be very flexible.
 The downside of being very flexible is the ever increase complexity of
 the file parser with each supplementary degree of freedom.
 So the first basic rule we decided to adopt was to be able to describe
 simple configuration in a simple way, even if the description of more complicat
ion configuration is then made also more complex.
 The second design rule the first version of the OEIT file format is to
 mainly address the need of the biomedical EIT community.
 The reason for this is to be able to start small and grown from there while
 attracting more and more people to the project, because of the authors
 background, and the pressing need for a common file format within the medical
 EIT community.
 That being said some non-medical feature have already be implemented in
 this version.
 The third and last design rule was to reuse as much code and already available
 application as possible this mainly concerns the binary coding scheme and
 the XML language validation for which we selected ZIP and Schema NG, respective
ly.
 Those choices impacted slightly the design of the format but offered a
 tremendous gain in the development time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specification requirement for OEIT were drafted based on the above rules
 and basic need of the community:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An OEIT file should be an ZIP-archive, which contains a hierarchical folder
 and file arrangement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It should be possible to describes EIT systems with the following features:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
voltage or current drive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
pair or multiple electrode drive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ground electrode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
serial and parallel measurement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
multiple data stream
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
OEIT should also be able to record external signals other than the one from
 the EIT instrument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One should also be able to record events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The OEIT file architecture should be flexible enough to easily introduce
 new features when required.
