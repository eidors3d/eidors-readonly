\begin{abstract}
Recently, Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) has begun to see a
significant clinical interest for monitoring of
ventilated patients.  The key capability of EIT is to
provide a real-time image distribution of ventilation in
the patient's lungs.
However, most clinical and physiological research in lung EIT
done using older and proprietary algorithms; this is
an obstacle to interpretation of EIT results because the
reconstructed images are not well characterized.
To address this issue, we propose to develop a 
consensus linear reconstruction algorithm for lung EIT.
This algorithm will be developed in three phases:
1) selection of the ``ingredients'' and evaluation 
methodology (this paper),
2) evaluation and experience with GREIT variants, and
3) consensus and definition of the GREIT algorithm.
This approach represents the consensus of a large and representative
group of experts in EIT algorithm and clinical applications.
All software and data to implement and test GREIT had been
made available under an open source license which allows free
research and commercial use.

\section{Introduction}
Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) measures conductivity
changes within a body from current stimulation and voltage
measurement on the body surface. One of the most promising
application of EIT is for measuring the lungs, since these
are large organs which undergo large changes in conductivity
during normal functioning. Indeed, lung function measurement
was the among first physiological applications of this technology
(refs). While there are many medical imaging and instrumentation
technologies to measure the distribution of ventilation
in the lungs, EIT is unique in that it
is able to non-invasively and continuously monitor the distribution of 
ventiolation. Based on these advantages, there is significant
interest in EIT to 
monitor mechanically ventilated patients.

One limitation is that most clinical and physiological research
on lung EIT is that being done using proprietary variants of
older image reconstruction algorithms, such as the backprojection
algorithm as implemented
in the Sheffield (Brown and Seagar, 1987)
or G\"ottingen (Hahn et al, 2001) EIT systems.
This is an obstacle to clinical use of EIT because:
1) it is difficult to determine whether a given image feature is 
an physiological or artefact,
2) comparison of regional ventilation is impacted by
algorithm spatial non-uniformity and position errors,
and 
3) multi-centre studies are not possible without a 
common imaging algorithm.
Many approaches to reconstruct EIT images have been proposed,
however, it has not easy to compare among them, because 
detailed comparisons of performance have not been done. 
However, there is general consensus amongst experts
in EIT image processing of the ``ingredients'' that should
be part of a robust and high performance algorithm.

We plan to address this problem, and to develop a
consensus linear reconstruction algorithm for EIT
images of the chest.
This algorithm is named GREIT, 
the ``Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT'',
since early discussions took place at the 2007 EIT conference
in Graz, Austria. Our aim is develop a standard which
has broad agreement from experts in the mathematical,
engineering, physiological, and clinical EIT communities.
The current work is limited to the reconstruction algorithm.
We do not propose calibration tests or phantoms, standards
for image interpretation or EIT based lung parameters; 
we do not feel this sufficient experience yet to reach
consensus in these areas.
It is important to clarify that there is no financial
goal to develoment of this algorithm. Participants have
agreed not to seek patent protection on this algorithm,
and all developed algorithms, simulation
models and simulation and experimental test data used
in this algorithm will been made available as part of
the EIDORS distribution (Adler and Lionheart, 2006).

Consensus was developed as follows: 1) a specific limited
set of goals were established, 2) experts were invited
to participate in the project, 3) a set of simulation models
and test criteria were established, 4) proposed algorithms
were tested against the criteria, and 5) results were judged
by the group to establish a consensus.
The goals were to develop an algorithm that was:
\begin{itemize}
\item Designed for 16 electrode Sheffield-type EIT systems, using
      adjacent current injection and measurement.
\item Uses electrodes placed in a single plane around the thorax.
\item Linear: implemented as a matrix multiplication and suitable
              for realtime imaging.
\item Quantitative: given an input in transfer impedance ($\Omega$) units,
                    the output is in impedivity change ($\Omega\cdot m$))
\item Fixed parameters: any tunable parameters must have assigned
                    values in the recommended algorithm.
\item All algorithms, models and test data to be made available
                    under an open source license which allows
                    free commercial and non-commercial use.
\item Reconstruction Matrices are to be developed for the
      following shapes:
   a) neonate chests, 
   b) adult chests, and 
   c) cylindrical tank phantoms.
\item Algorithms are tested against the following criteria:
    a) quantitative output for all positions,
    b) reconstructed position error (low and uniform),
    c) resolution (small PSF, uniform, few artefacts),
    d) good noise performance,
    e) low sensitivity to electrode and boundary movement,
    f) good performance on clinical and experimental data.
\end{itemize}
A notable limitation is that we only treat imaging in
a single plane and do not consider 3D electrode placement or
image reconstruction. These are important considerations, but
do not yet have the level of consensus to establish a best
practice document of this type.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Models}

Finite element models (FEM) have been developed for three
different geometries: a cylindrical phantom (useful for 
phantom studies and experimental testing), a
neonate chest and an adult chest. The primary difference
between the neonate and adult chest shapes are due to
the size of the electrodes.

\subsection{Algorithms}
\subsection{Evaluation: model data}

Each algorithm will be evaluated against the
following criteria.

\subsubsection{Amplitude Response}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Output amplitude is correct ($\Omega \cdot m$)
   \item the amplitude response is uniform for all radial positions.
   \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Position Error}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item low average position error
   \item uniform position error with radial position
   \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ Resolution}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item small average PSF size
   \item uniform PSF size with radial position
   \item no (or very little) overshoot in the PSF
  (overshoot is the negative ring around a target)
   \item regular shape (round or oval) PSF
  (backprojection, with its streaks, does badly here)
   \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ Noise Performance}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item low average noise amplification
   \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ Boundary shape and electrode sensitivity}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item low sensitivity to electrode movement
   \item low sensitivity to boundary distortions
         (with breathing and posture change)
   \item low sensitivity to changes in electrode contact impedance
   \end{itemize}


\subsection{Evaluation: experimental data}


 good performance on real clinical images.
     (NB, we need to develop a small database of 
          clinical images to do this)

\subsection{Summary}
\section{Discusion}

In summary, we have developed an algorithm (GREIT)
for reconstruction of images of the thorax
from 16 EIT electrodes placed in a single plane
around the chest. This algorithm does not represent
new ideas in image reconstruction, but rather represent
a ``best of breed'' algorithm based on the experience
of a group of experts in EIT algorithms and clinical
applications.

\item[]
   -- one dimension parameter (the chest lateral diameter) 
\item[]
   -- $13\times 16=208$ measurements in transfer impedance units
      ($\Omega = \frac{\mbox{Measured voltage}}
                      {\mbox{Stimulation current}}$)

\\
   -- a pixelized image ($32\times 32$) of 
      impedivity change ($\Omega \cdot m$)


      This matrix consists of a mapping matrix $\MB$ (size $32\times 32$ of
      integers) and a reconstruction matrix $\RB$ (size $104\times P$ of
      floating point doubles).
      Given a vector $\vB$ of difference voltage measurements, where
      the $i^{\rm th}$ measurement on stimulation pattern $j$ is
      $\vB_{i+16\times(j-1)}$. A 
      The index in $\MB$ corresponding to each output pixel
      (Fig. \ref{fig:reconst_detail}) gives a row ind index into the
      reconstruction matrix
