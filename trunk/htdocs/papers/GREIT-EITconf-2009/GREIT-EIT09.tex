\mysection{Introduction}

One of the most promising applications of EIT is for
monitoring the distribution of breathing in ventilated
patients. Based on EIT images, ventilation strategies could
be optimised to hopefully improve gas exchange and reduce
ventilator induced lung injury. One key limitation is that
the majority of clinical and experimental EIT research
has been performed with the Sheffield back-projection
reconstruction algorithm developed in the early 90's; this
is an obstacle to interpretation of EIT images because
the reconstructed images are not well characterised. To
address this issue, we are developing a consensus linear
reconstruction algorithm for lung EIT, called GREIT (Graz
consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT).  The goal of
GREIT is to develop a consensus on the desired properties
of a linear reconstruction algorithm, and implement an
approach to achieve a good fit to these properties.
This paper describes the GREIT image reconstruction
framework developed, and
current work to choose select values for
algorithm parameter to provide stable and 
accurate clinical images.

\mysection{GREIT Image Reconstruction Framework}

The framework developed\cite{GREIT09} consists of: 1)
detailed finite element models of a representative adult
and neonatal thorax; 2) consensus on the performance
figures of merit for EIT image reconstruction; and 3) a
systematic approach to optimise a linear reconstruction
matrix to desired performance measures (Fig.\ \ref{fig:figparams}, Left).
The consensus figures of merit (Fig.\ \ref{fig:figparams}, Centre)
 in agreed order of importance,
are: a) uniform amplitude response (AR), b) small and
uniform position error (PE), c) small ringing artefacts (RNG),
d) uniform resolution (RES), e) limited shape deformation (SD),
and f) high resolution (RES). 
As shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:figparams} (Right), GREIT is able to 
achieve more uniform spatial resolution with low ringing at the
expense of a decrease in spatial resolution near the boundary.

\mysection{Selection of parameter values}

Several parameters in the GREIT framework need to be
determined based on a careful evaluation strategy.
The key parameters which need to
be determined are:
1) training noise levels,
2) model accuracy,
3) the use (or not) of normalized difference imaging,
4) parameter settings for movement compensation, and
5) assumptions about the background (reference)
   conductivity of the thorax.

Current work indicates that the parameter with the most
significant impact on reconstructed images is the
reference conductivity used. While most difference EIT
images of the lungs assume a homogeneous conductivity 
distribution, this is clearly not valid for the thorax. 
The homogeneous assumption tests to ``squeeze'' the lung
images together. Fig.\ \ref{fig:figbackgnd} shows images
of tidal volume in a pig lung injury model (data from 
\cite{frerichs03}) and the effect of the background
conductivity parameter.

Clinical and experimental evaluation of GREIT is being
performed in order to choose appropriate algorithm values,
and evaluate image reconstruction performance with "real"
data. A collection of clinical and experimental data has
been assembled from animal, neonatal  and adult studies
in Canada, Germany, UK and USA. Evaluation will consist
of reconstructing images with variants of GREIT, and
asking experts to score the images.  One concern with any
new medical imaging algorithm is its performance in the
presence of data artefacts. With experience, such artefacts
can be identified in the images; but such experience needs
to be developed for a new algorithm.  Thus, another goal
of GREIT evaluation is to develop a set of heuristics,
both visual and automatic, to detect such data errors.

\mysection{Discussion}

The goal of GREIT is to develop a well characterised 2D
linear difference EIT algorithm for lung imaging. We seek to develop
a robust algorithm which incorporates the key developments
in EIT lung image reconstructon. Our experience to date
with GREIT shows improvements in resolution of image features
as well as reduced image artefacts over the Sheffield backprojection
algorithm. In order to facilitate use of GREIT,
all software
and data to implement and test the algorithm have been
made available on the internet at eidors.org/GREIT under
an open source license which allows free research and
commercial use.
