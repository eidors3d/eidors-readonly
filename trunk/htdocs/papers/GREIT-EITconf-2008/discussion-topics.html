    first paragraph currently specifies 'mechanically ventilated
 patients' (and indeed these are of most direct interest to my own
 company's customers) but there is clinical interest in the wider field
 of 'patients with respiratory compromise' or some such, to encompass
 both mechanical ventilation and also spontaneous breathing.

|  b) if (as I agree is a good idea) an 2x8 electrode configuration, then
|  presumably there is a second length parameter required to characterize
|  the distance between electrode planes (whether given as a length, or
|  equivalently as a pure ratio to the first length parameter) - should
|  this be made explicit?
</pre>

It would be better to make the inter-ring spacing a set fraction
of the laterial diameter.
<p>
Note, however, that the idea of doing 2x8 is a little controversial
since it is not sufficiently well-understood. (ie stimulation
sequences are still debatable). However, we can have two levels
of GREIT output:
<br>&minus;
1. Models where we specify everything, and calculate the 
    reconstruction matrix. (16x1 electrodes, Sheffield style)
<br>&minus;
2. Models where we specify how to do it, but the exact forward
    model and stimulation would need to be done by the
    implementor. (examples 8x2, different patient shapes, etc)

|  c) the paper does not (at least to my reading) specify anything
|  regarding the 'axial' length of the 'square' 2d output grid, and yet
|  this may modify the results of any trials? Or is there an assumption
|  that I have not recognized that the forward model has impedivity uniform
|  in the (Z?) axis? This assumption is inherent in all the true 2d
|  reconstruction methods, but is also known not to be true in the human
|  chest and is a key driver for 3d electrode configurations.
</pre>

The height (axial length) of the output grid is a parameter which
is subject to debate. With infinite height, we have what's called
2.5D reconstruction. I think we're better with h=0.5xdiam. I'm
also not sure whether is has much effect.

|  d) (here I may be showing my ignorance) is it inherent in a linear
|  reconstruction algorithm that PSF size has direct (reciprocal) relation
|  to ability to resolve (distinguish) two distinct impedance features in
|  the forward model? And if not, is there any benefit in making this an
|  explicit metric?
</pre>

I think you could show that distinguishability is related to PSF and
noise. Yes, it may be worth making this explicit.

|  e) is it really acceptable to leave so much undefined in the evaluation
|  metrics (is this use of term metric accepted in this discipline - I've
|  borrowed it from software engineering) or could it be argued that this
|  leaves it open to cook the metrics to suit the sort of cake we end up
|  with? I can appreciate that we do not yet have the information required
