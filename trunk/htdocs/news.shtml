<b>EIDORS code-a-thon<a name="workshop2013"></a></b>
<br>
Several EIDORS developers got together in Manchester, UK to
work on adding new features and squashing old bugs. 
Priorities for the workshop were:
1) Geophysics
2) GREIT: target distributions and other defaults, electrode errors
3) Bill's c2f mapper
4) Electrode interface for netgen 2d models
5) place_elec_on_surf
6) move normalize_measurements from fwd_model to inv_model gracefully. Take care of calc_difference_data

<b>EIDORS and "New Physics"</b>
<br>
We've decided on an infrastructure to allow "new physics" to be encoded
onto a forward model. This will remain (mostly) backwards compatible, but
will permit us to better support new problem formulations and multimodality
physics. Examples of physics and their encoding are:
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" >
<tr><th>Property<th>Encoding
<tr>
   <td>Generic image<br> information
   <td> <tt>img.elem_data</tt>
   <br> or
   <br> <tt>img.node_data</tt> (no change)
   <br> These fields will by default be interpreted as conductivity
          (by forward solvers)
<tr>
   <td>Conductivity
   <td> <tt>img.conductivity.elem_data</tt>
   <br> or
   <br> <tt>img.conductivity.node_data</tt> (no change)
<tr>
   <td>Log conductivity
   <td> <tt>img.log_conductivity.elem_data</tt>
<tr>
   <td>Movement
   <td> <tt>img.conductivity.elem_data</tt> and
   <br> <tt>img.movement.electrode_data</tt> or
   <br> <tt>img.movement.node_data</tt> or
<tr>
   <td>Anisotropic<br> Conductivity
   <td> <tt>img.elem_data(elem#,img#,:,:)</tt>
   <br> so each element has an individual tensor
   <br> Functions to create anisotropic
        images from eigenfunctions will be provided

<b>EIDORS Version 3.6 release</b>
<p>Blobby the walrus is proud to release EIDORS version 3.6,
available at <a href="www.eidors.org">www.eidors.org</a>. 
This release includes:
<ul>
  <li> improvements to advanced solvers (electrode movement 
reconstructions in 3D, 4D reconstruction)
  <li> better support for complex conductivity
  <li> experimental support for higher order FEM
  <li> improved 3D visualization
  <li> expanded support for meshing software and 
  <li> several bug fixes and code speedups. 
</ul>
Additionally, in order to make EIDORS easier to use and 
maintain, function names have been standardized to reflect their purpose.
Several older functions have been deprecated (you may see several warnings when running 
older code). 
<br>
All  <a href="http://eidors3d.sourceforge.net/tutorial/tutorial.shtml">
Tutorials</a> have been revised and new ones are available. 
<br> The default
solvers are now set at startup and centrally managed through the 
<a href="http://eidors3d.sourceforge.net/doc/eidors/tools/eidors_default.html">eidors_default</a> function.
<br>
Because of the many renamed functions, it will be increasingly difficult for the developers to answer questions pertaining to older versions of EIDORS, so we request all users to update.

You can now take EIDORS with you! Andrea Borsic and 
Andy Adler got EIDORS to run on the Nokia N900 mobile phone by
installing Octave, Gnuplot, texinfo, and EIDORS to the phone. It is OK
for 2D solvers (576 element inverse solutions in about 25 sec), but would
be a little too slow for 3D problems.


<p><li><b>

Blobby the EIDORS walrus is releasing version 3.3
(www.eidors.org).  This version incorporates many changes,
bug fixes and code speedups. Since v3.3RC1, we have added
the Sheffield MKI backprojection algorithm (thanks to
David Barber and Brian Brown), added tutorials and made
several small bug fixes.  New features since v3.3 include:
a) interfaces to FEM generation (distmesh, netgen) and
dual model solvers, b) new algorithms (total variation,
electrode movement solver, temporal solvers), c) a data
repository with in vivo and simulated data and models,

Andy Adler, Bill Lionheart, Andrea Borsic met with Nick Polydorides at MIT for the week. We made progress on a number of fronts including reintegrating Nick's 2D version of his code and validating it against Andy's. We made a start in incorporating MCMC methods in EIDORS and worked on boundary shape. Validation of 3D codes against each other showed a bug that had crept in to the forward solver in algroithms/n_polydorides which caused an error of relative size 1e-5 under some circumstances. We also had the great pleasure of meeting Gilbert Strang who introduced us to <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~persson/mesh/">distmesh</a>, which we are now planning to include in EIDORS.

Caching interface for EIDORS
<br>
Andy Adler
<p>
After thinking about how to implement caching for a while, I've
finally implemented one approach. The idea is that each object
must be 'hashed' to get an ID. If we calculate the image for data
we've already seen, then we must be able to detect that fact.
<p>
Some issues are:
<br>&minus; We can't simply keep a pointer to previous variables.
     For example, the Jacobian is used many times. Each time
     it normally calculated for a homogeneous background, but
     the actual variable representing the background is different.
<br>&minus; Cross-platform cross version support. We need to support
     (Unix + Windows) &times; (Matlab v6 + v7 + octave). Windows
     makes it difficult to 'shell' out to a helper program. The various
     software packages make Mex type functions a compatibility issue.
<br>&minus; Matlab Mex file limitations make it difficult to get pointers
     to the raw data storage for variables.
<p>
<b>Design:</b>
The following design was chosen. In the eidors object constructor
<tt>eidors_obj.m</tt>, and obj_id is calculated for each variable
by saving it to disk, and then running the file through the
SHA1 hash, and deleting the file.
The mex file <tt>matrix_id.cpp</tt> is used to calculate
the SHA1. Because the Matlab V6 file format puts a comment header with
the save time in the first 125 bytes, it is necessary to begin the
hash after that point.
<p>
<b>Questions:</b>
<br>&minus; Should the saved files be deleted? If not, it may be a nice
way to improve overall performance. If files are kept, we need to user
selected <tt>EIDORS_TMPDIR</tt> in which to put the files.

<br>&minus; Not all cached data is useful. For example each measured
data set will end up in the cache as currently implemented. 
One advantage of the current implementation, however, is 
the way that it can 'remember' if it has seen previous data without
actually storing that data. This would allow user selection of
which variables to cache.

<b>Minutes:</b>
<ol>
<li> Everyone introduced themselves

<li> It was agreed by all that the code circulated for this meeting that was not
yet released would be treated as confidential, as the authors needed a chance
to publish papers on their work first. When ready the authors can contribute
it to the eidors3d source tree on sourceforge.net either themselves or via
one one of those registered as developers.

<li> Current work in EIT and with EIDORS software was discussed.

<li> Standard file formats.<br>
(AA) As we develop project we have a chance to set a standard.
<br>

(RB) Kevin Boon suggested standard data format in Ankara. Confidential medical
data, patient owns it.
Community has to be seen to respect medical data (eg name prognosis.). Phantom
data not an issue. Cant just send a data file. Issue about type of system.
Collection protocol, dynamic range, data scaling. Electrode placement within
error. In real data another level, may need to preprocess to data.
Do we want EIDORS to be a teaching tool or a more advanced tool.
Reverse is to say what syntax EIDORS needs.
<br>

(RB) Image format. SPN, statistical parametric modelling. What is output
format.  VTK?
30 Images different freq. Need for comparison of data.
<br>


(AA) Symantic difficulty, cond on vertices, elements, mapping to cut planes.
So what is image? Rasterizing.
<br>


(NP) Test set for others to compare. Dist with EIDORS.
<br>


(RB) OT, see Martin Schweiger's web site at UCL.
There is lots of error checking in TOAST. This can be an issue when trying to
adapt the code to a different application.
<br>


(AA) Defining a new standard would raise political issues. On the other hand,
simply saying that "this is what you need to work with EIDORS" is easier.
<br>


<i>Action</i>: AA -- consult  OT people (HD). Check with RB for head, JLD for Process
Tomography.
<br>

Models meshes -- standard file formats. Can we use standard ones? Iges, EDS,
Universal File Format,
SLT (parametric surface).

Mesh quality factors.
<br>

<li>  (AA) API and plugable algorithms.
<br>

Want to easily plug in new idea and compare with named reference algorithms.
API written so this is easy but also safe.
<br>

(RB) Grid algorithms, multiple self contained program, moduarity.
<br>

<li>   CVS version on source forge.
<br>
Octave compatible using if statements to bypass matlab graphics.
Matlab OO. Not well written. Use structures instead

<br>&minus;<i>
data </i> - measurements, units, time, comment,
              electrode positions, current pattern

<br>&minus;<i>
fwd_model</i> - FEM, electrode posn. and models,
        excitation / meas. patterns, electrode models

<br>&minus;<i>
inv_model</i> - hyperparameters, pointers to code

<br>&minus;<i>
image</i> - image data, pointers to fwd_model, inv_model


<br>    Basic Methods:
<br>&minus;
fwd_solve, inv_solve, jacobian, etc.
<br>&minus;
methods call alg. specific
<br>&minus;
'centralized' caching to avoid repeat calcs

Demo_real modified on CVS tree to do this.
<br>

Discussion on packing un packing
<br>
AA explained the "copy on write" issue in matlab. If you assign one big array
to another it does not make a copy until you assign to the old one. Care is
needed to avoid meemory bloat.
<br>

DS and LH wondered whether this structure is appropriate for computationally
intensive problems.
<br>

<i>Action</i> LH and DS to look at AA's structures and see how it would suit their problems.

<br>

(WL) Are we prepared to make big changes now, such as changes to variable
names.
Yes, as long as we carry the main users with us. Proposed major changes will
be discussed on eidors-3d listserv.

<br>


<li> Research Issues
(RB) Cross continent funding? Grid computing -- no real applications?
"e-science community"
<br>

Action: AA to check on Canadian position.
RB To check on Grid stuff. Large computing, para'l computing.
<br>

(AA) Testabilty big deal in software eng. Not much work on numerical
algorithms. Inverse problems and medical imaging.
<br>
(RB) Design for testability
<br>
(BG) Has MS in CS , code inspection at RMC s/w for nuclear inspection.
<br>
(WL) Testing of of IP software, so that one transparently avoids any cheating,
whether or not intended, seems to be an interesting issue.
<br>
(RB) VLSI, scalability testing. TOAST experience suggests problem we might
encounter when code grows. Do we need built in test methods in EIDORS as it
grows?
<br>


 (AA) This is a great multidisciplinary collaboration. We need good testing
now.
<br>
 Repositary for standard data and  Meshes, as well as standard algorithms.
<br>


<li> (RB) Suggested giving EIDORS a higher profile on eit.org.uk to encourage
contributions. (WL) Suggested that we consolodate changes with the main
groups actively developing EIDORS first.
<br>

<li> AOB: The meeting thanked the AG coordinators, the video conferencing went
well apart from a loss of audio.
<br>

<li> It was agreed to schedule a meeting in about two months with London and
Dartmouth both joining us over AG as well.
 Action: HD, RB, AA, WL to check availability of their AG nodes.

    23 June 2004: Discussion
</b><br> W.R.B. Lionheart, A. Adler
<p>
In order to further EIDORS development, we developed the
following desirata for EIDORS software.
<ul>
    <li> <b>
        API design
    </b><br>
    EIDORS needs a clean, well-encapsulated and easy to understand
    API. We do not feel that an object oriented API is particularly
    useful because:
    1) the Matlab OO design is somewhat of a "hack"
    2) such an OO interface would make portability to other 
       languages less easy

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Language portability
    </b><br>
    EIDORS is primarily aimed at MATLAB. We would like to EIDORS
    to support Octave and Scilab, as far as possible. Currently,
    Octave and Scilab have the features needed by EIDORS (sparse
    matrices, 3D matrix support, etc.)
    <p>
    In the core, it should be possible to have portability. However,
    Matlab graphics features are not supported in these languages.
    Our idea is therefore to separate the graphics functions
    from the core code. Graphics code would therefore be permitted
    to be language specific.
    <p>
    Another desirable feature would be to support approaches
    to enhance execution speed: ie. C functions, multiprocessor
    support, etc. This is dealt with under <i>plug-in algorithms</i>

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Platform portability
    </b><br>
    EIDORS is intended to work on all platforms with support 
    Matlab/Scilab/Octave. This means Unix/Windows/Mac OSX.
    In order to do this, we have the following rules:
    <br>&minus; No spaces in file names
    <br>&minus; The path separator is '/'
    <br>&minus; File names are lower case letters and 
              numbers with optional underscores

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Plugin algorithms
    </b><br>
    Many users will want to use EIDORS infrastructure to test their
    own ideas. EIDORS should support <i>plugging in</i> such new
    algorithms or techniques. 
    <p>
    It is not obvious to us at this point exactly what features
    need to be added. Thus is is likely that some refactoring
    of the code will be required as we learn more about users needs.
    Please contact the authors with suggestions.

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Reference algorithms
    </b><br>
    One of the main goals of EIDORS is to allow people to compare
    their <i>new fangled algorithms</i> to those implemented by others.
    Unfortunately, the typical approach in this field has been to 
    compare the <i>new fangled</i> to badly implement versions 
    of others.
    Ideally, EIDORS will make it easy to do the comparison 
    correctly, <i>if desired</i>.
    <p>
    EIDORS should therefore offer:
    1) use of the <i>latest  and greatest</i>
        algorithms,
        and
    2) use of specific algorithms corresponding to
        specific papers

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Simple and transparent code-base
    </b><br>
    EIDORS code is primarily aimed at numerical researchers.
    This means EIDORS should be:
    <br>&minus; simple. Code should be sufficiently small for 
        an interested person to learn quite quickly
    <br>&minus; command line based. Code should expose it's capabilities
        and internal structure for inclusion into other algorithms.
        Graphic interface contributions will be accepted, but will
        be placed outside of the core.
    <br>&minus; modifiable. Many users will want to modify EIDORS
        to try their own ideas. This should be reasonably easy
        to do.
    <br>&minus;

    <li> <b>

    would include.
