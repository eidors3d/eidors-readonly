<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ol>
<p><li><b>
What is EIDORS3D?
</b><p>
The goal of EIDORS3D is to promote collaboration between 
groups working on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and Diffusion based
Optical Tomography, in medical and industrial settings.

<p><li><b>
How is EIDORS3D pronounced?
</b><p>
EIDORS3D is pronounced like eiderdown. That means
is sounds like <i>eye doors three dee</i>.
<br>
Note: correct pronounciation will make you compliant
with <i>Bill Lionheart</i>.

<p><li><b>
What is the logo?
</b><p>
The logo is a walrus. EIDORS3D images
blobby objects in aqueous media; similarly, the walrus
is a fat, blobby animal that lives in water.
The original (high resolution) image of the one used here is from the
NOAA. See <a href="http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/animals/anim0030.htm"
>www.photolib.noaa.gov/animals/anim0030.htm</a>. For another
great picture of fat waruses see this

<p><li id="maintainers"><b>
    Whom should I blame or thank or contact for more information?
</b><p>
The current maintainers of EIDORS3D are
<a href="mailto:bill.lionh&#101;&#97;rt@umist.ac.uk">Bill Lionheart</a>
and
<a href="mailto:&#97;dl&#101;r@site.uott&#97;w&#97;.c&#97;"
    >Andy Adler</a>.
Please contact them with suggestions, contribution of code,
and contribution of sample data, meshes, and algorithms.

<!--
<p><li><b>
    How do I get started with EIDORS3D?
</b><p>

<p><li><b>
    Are there any prebuilt examples?
</b><p>
-->

<p><li><b>
    Under what terms is EIDORS3D licenced
</b><p>
EIDORS3D is licenced under the GNU 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"
    >General Public License</a>. Uses are free to
use, modify, and distribute their modifications.
All modifications must include the source code, or
instructions on how to obtain it.

<p><li><b>
    May I include EIDORS3D in a commercial product
</b><p>
Yes. As long as you make the source code for EIDORS
and all possible modifications to it available.

<p><li><b>
    How should I refer to EIDORS3D in a scientific publication
</b><p>
For the core EIDORS3D code, based on the work of Nick Polydorides,
you may quote the following paper
<blockquote>
Nick Polydorides and William R B Lionheart 2002
A Matlab toolkit for three-dimensional electrical impedance tomography: a contribution to the Electrical Impedance and Diffuse Optical Reconstruction Software project
<i>
    Meas. Sci. Technol.</i> 13(12):1871-1883
</blockquote>

Code which implements other published algorithms will also be included
with EIDORS3D. References to the appropriate publications will be
listed in the source code. Hopefully, we will include a list
of references here, also.

<p><li><b>
    Does EIDORS3D support 2D algorithms
</b><p>
Yes.

<!--
<p><li><b>
    How do I use EIDORS3D to compare my idea to a 
    published algorithm
</b><p>
Please remember that this is only a toolkit, and that the
demonstration programs are only simple worked examples. They are
not intended to be the state of the art in EIT reconstruction. By all
means publish your improved reconstruction algorithms and compare them
with the simple ones we demonstrate here. But please don't just run
the demo code on your own data, using the tiny demo mesh, a randomly
chosen regularization parameter and only one iteration of regularized
Newton's method then compare this with your own highly optimised code
and claim that your code is vastly superior than EIDORS' best shot
(Yes, I exagerate, slightly).
This is a toolkit of routines for you to build a code which suits your
application.

<p><li><b>
    How do I use EIDORS3D as a framework to develop my
    <i>new fangled</i> algorithm / idea?
</b><p>
-->

<p><li><b>
    What if I notice a bug?
</b><p>
You may write an email to the <a href="#maintainers">maintainers</a>.

<p><li><b>
    I need some features that are missing in EIDORS3D?
</b><p>
Please note that EIDORS3D is a volunteer project by some
very busy people. You are welcome to make suggestions
for new features, but we are unlikely to be able to
find the time to implement them.
<p>
Good options are: 1) implement new features yourself,
and contribute them to EIDORS3D, or 2) find a source
of funds to pay for the features you need. In either case,
you are welcome to contact the 
<a href="#maintainers">maintainers</a> to discuss.
