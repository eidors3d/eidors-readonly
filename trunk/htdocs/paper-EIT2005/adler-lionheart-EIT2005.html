Abstract
</H3>

EIDORS3D is an open source software suite for image reconstruction in
electrical impedance tomography and diffuse optical tomography;
designed to facilitate collaboration, testing and new research
in these fields.  This paper describes recent work to
redesign the software structure in order to simplify its use,
and provide a uniform interface,
permitting easier modification and customization.
We describe the key features of this structure, followed by
examples of its use, and an outline of future directions
for development.

Introduction
</H3>

EIDORS3D is a software suite for image reconstruction in
electrical impedance tomography and diffuse optical tomography.
The goal is to provide a freely distributable and modifyable
software suite for image reconstruction of electrical 
or diffuse optical data. Such software facilitates research
in these fields by providing a reference implementation
against which new developments can be compared, and by
providing a functioning software base onto which new
ideas may be built and tested.
The original EIDORS software (Vaukhonen et al., 2000) 
is based on software from the thesis of Vaukhonen (1997)
It implemented a MATLAB package for two-dimensional mesh generation,
solving of the forward
problem and reconstructing and displaying the reconstructed images.
In order to provide capability to solve 3D reconstruction models,
a new project, EIDORS3D, was begun (Polydorides and Lionheart, 2002),
based on the software developed for thesis of Polydorides (2002).
The EIDORS software packages shared the same numerical
foundations; media are modelled using a finite element representation,
and the images are reconstructed using regularized inverse techniques.

<p>
In the three years since the publication of EIDORS3D, several patterns
of use have been noted. Researchers typically download the software,
run the provided demonstration examples, and modify them, and 
make modifications in the demonstration examples and the software
internals to meet their needs.
Because of lack of a modular software structure of EIDORS3D,
changes tended to made into the code itself. This resulted in
duplicated
code which could not easily be <i>modularized</i> in order to
be contributed back to EIDORS3D. Also, as recent work has begun to move
away from basic reconstruction algorithms, focussing
on such issues as mesh generation, electrode modelling, visualization
and electrode error detection. This research would be facilitated
by using modular components which could be <i>plugged</i> into
a selection of reconstruction algorithms.
</p>
<p>To address these issues, the EIDORS3D software has been completely
restructured with the goal of providing an <i>extensible software base</i>,
designed to support <i>community</i> use, modification and contribution.
This has been accomplished by the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Sourceforge hosting </b>
EIDORS3D is hosted by <tt>sourceforge.net</tt>
at <tt>http://eidors3d.sf.net</tt>. This tool allows for collaborative
development for group members, while permitting all users to access the
code. </li>
  <li> <b> Language independance: Octave and Matlab </b> While
EIDORS3D was originally written for Matlab, the eventual goal is for
language independance. Currently EIDORS works with Octave (version &ge;
2.1.66) and Matlab (version &ge; 6.0). </li>
  <li> <b> Pluggable code base </b> "Pluggable" software allows users
to modify functions by adding new modules, without
needing to make changes to the underlying code. This offers similar
capabilities to an object oriented implementation, although it was been
instead implemented using function pointers. </li>
  <li> <b> Automatic value caching </b> In order to increase
performance of image reconstruction software, it is important to cache
computationally expensive variables, such as the Jacobian. Such caching
complicates the software implementation. To solve this problem,
EIDORS3D extracts caching to a separate module which is inhereted by
each functional module. </li>
  <li> <b> Generalized data formats </b> In order to support the wide
variety of EIT measurements and algorithms, a general EIT data format
structure is developed. </li>
  <li> <b> Interface software for common EIT systems </b> Functions
to load data from some common EIT systems to the generalized data
format have been developed. </li>
  <li> <b> Usage examples </b> Some simple and more complex usage
examples are provided. </li>
  <li> <b> Open-source license </b> EIDORS3D is licenced under the
GNU General Public License. Uses are free to use, modify, and
distribute their modifications. All modifications must include the
source code, or instructions on how to obtain it. EIDORS3D may be used
in a commercial product, as long as the source code for EIDORS and all
modifications to it are made available.
  </li>
</ul>
We hope that by providing a structure for community collaboration
in EIT algorithms we can produce robust,
reliable and fairly portable software which draws on our collective
expertise and facilitates innovations in the field.

<h3> Software Architecture
</h3>

<ul>
  <li> <b> Forward Models
       </b>

  <li> <b> Inverse Models
       </b>

  <li> <b> Data Format
       </b>
</ul>

<h3> Usage Examples
</h3>

<ul>
  <li> <b> Usage Example: 
       </b>
  This example shows how to test EIT image reconstructions from 
  two different algorithms on a given data set.

  <li> <b> Inverse Models:
       </b>
  This example shows how modify an existing algorithm to test the
  effect of a modification. In this example, we wish to modify the
  hyperparameter selection strategy of Polydorides (2002) to use
  instead the <i>Noise Figure</i> parameter introduced by
  Adler and Guardo.

</ul>
