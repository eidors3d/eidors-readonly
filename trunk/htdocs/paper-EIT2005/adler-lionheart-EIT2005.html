Abstract
</H3>

EIDORS3D is an open source software suite for image reconstruction in
electrical impedance tomography and diffuse optical tomography;
designed to facilitate collaboration, testing and new research
in these fields.  This paper describes recent work to
redesign the software structure in order to simplify its use,
and provide a uniform interface,
permitting easier modification and customization.
We describe the key features of this structure, followed by
examples of its use, and an outline of future directions
for development.

<H3>
Introduction
</H3>

EIDORS3D is a software suite for image reconstruction in
electrical impedance tomography and diffuse optical tomography.
The goal is to provide a freely distributable and modifyable
software suite for image reconstruction of electrical 
or diffuse optical data. Such software facilitates research
in these fields by providing a reference implementation
against which new developments can be compared, and by
providing a functioning software base onto which new
ideas may be built and tested.
The original EIDORS software (Vaukhonen et al., 2000) 
is based on software from the thesis of Vaukhonen (1997)
It implemented a MATLAB package for two-dimensional mesh generation,
solving of the forward
problem and reconstructing and displaying the reconstructed images.
In order to provide capability to solve 3D reconstruction models,
a new project, EIDORS3D, was begun (Polydorides and Lionheart, 2002),
based on the software developed for thesis of Polydorides (2002).
The EIDORS software packages shared the same numerical
foundations; media are modelled using a finite element representation,
and the images are reconstructed using regularized inverse techniques.

<p>
In the three years since the publication of EIDORS3D, several patterns
of use have been noted. Researchers typically download the software,
run the provided demonstration examples, and modify them, and 
make modifications in the demonstration examples and the software
internals to meet their needs.
Because of lack of a modular software structure of EIDORS3D,
changes tended to made into the code itself. This resulted in
duplicated
code which could not easily be <i>modularized</i> in order to
be contributed back to EIDORS3D. Also, as recent work has begun to move
away from basic reconstruction algorithms, focussing
on such issues as mesh generation, electrode modelling, visualization
and electrode error detection. This research would be facilitated
by using modular components which could be <i>plugged</i> into
a selection of reconstruction algorithms.
</p>
<p>To address these issues, the EIDORS3D software has been completely
restructured with the goal of providing an <i>extensible software base</i>,
designed to support <i>community</i> use, modification and contribution.
This has been accomplished by the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Sourceforge hosting:</b>
EIDORS3D is hosted by <tt>sourceforge.net</tt>
at <tt>http://eidors3d.sf.net</tt>.
Software is available for download as packaged released versions
(version 2.0 contains the modification described in this paper),
or the latest developments may be downloaded from the CVS
version control repository.
Sourceforge hosting allows for collaborative development for
group members, while permitting anyone to read-only access.
In order to become a member of the developer group, new
contributors should contact the authors.

  <li> <b> Language independance: (Octave and Matlab)</b>
EIDORS3D was originally written for Matlab.
However, the eventual goal is for language independance.
The current version of EIDORS3D works with Octave
(<tt>www.octave.org</tt>, version &ge; 2.9.3)
and Matlab (version &ge; 6.0).
Since Octave is free software, EIDORS3D could be provided
as part of an EIT system without incurring the additional
licensing costs of Matlab.


  <li> <b> Pluggable code base:</b>
In order to facilitate user modifications, EIDORS3D
has been designed to provide some of the benefits of
Object-oriented (OO) software: <i>Packaging</i>
 and <I>Abstraction</i>. We have decided not to
use the OO framework provided by Matlab, because
it appears somewhat cumbersome, and may be intimidating
to many mathematicians and engineers who do not 
regularly write OO software. This decision may
be revisited in the future.
Instead, EIDORS3D has been designed as 
"Pluggable" software. This design uses function
pointers to allow adding new modules and modifying
in which parts of functions are executed.
A detailed description of this capability is
provided in the next section.

  <li> <b> Automatic matrix caching: </b> 
In order to increase
performance of image reconstruction software, it is important to cache
computationally expensive variables, such as the Jacobian. Such caching
complicates the software implementation. To solve this problem,
EIDORS3D extracts caching to a separate module which is inhereted by
each functional module. This capability is described in the next section.

  <li> <b> Generalized data formats </b> In order to support the wide
variety of EIT measurements and algorithms, a general EIT data format
structure is developed. </li>
  <li> <b> Interface software for common EIT systems </b> Functions
to load data from some common EIT systems to the generalized data
format have been developed. </li>
  <li> <b> Usage examples </b> Some simple and more complex usage
examples are provided. </li>
  <li> <b> Open-source license </b> EIDORS3D is licenced under the
GNU General Public License. Uses are free to use, modify, and
distribute their modifications. All modifications must include the
source code, or instructions on how to obtain it. EIDORS3D may be used
in a commercial product, as long as the source code for EIDORS and all
modifications to it are made available.
  </li>
</ul>
We hope that by providing a structure for community collaboration
in EIT algorithms we can produce robust,
reliable and fairly portable software which draws on our collective
expertise and facilitates innovations in the field.

<h3> Software Architecture
</h3>

<h4> Sofware architecture
</h4>

In order to illustrate the usage of EIDORS3D, we consider
the calculation of the Jacobian or sensitivity matrix, <b>J</b>
Given a finite element model (FEM) model of an EIT medium,
<i>F</i>, we calculate the vector of voltages, <b>v</b>, 
at each FEM vertex as:
<center>
<b>v</b> = <i>F</i>(<b>&sigma;</b>) <b>q</b>
</center>
where <b>&sigma;</b> is the vector of element conductivites
and <b>q</b> is the current stimulation pattern, a vector
of current inputs to each vertex (Neumann boundary conditions).
Depending on the electrode model used, the measured electrode
voltage can be represented as a linear combination of vertex
voltages, <b>V</b><sub>2E</sub>.
For each simulation pattern, <b>q</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>,
measurements <i>m</i><sub><i>i</i>,<i>j</i></sub>
are performed, each of which consist of a linear combination of
electrode measurements, <b>m</b><sub><i>j</i></sub>.
Thus:
<center>
<i>m</i><sub><i>i</i>,<i>j</i></sub> =
<b>m</b><sub><i>j</i></sub>
<b>V</b><sub>2E</sub>
<i>F</i>(<b>&sigma;</b>) <b>q</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>
</center>
Based on this model, <b>J</b> is calculated as:
<center>
<b>J</b><sub><i>i</i>,<i>j</i>,<i>k</i></sub> =
<b>m</b><sub><i>j</i></sub>
<b>V</b><sub>2E</sub>
&part;<i>F</i>(<b>&sigma;</b>) <b>q</b><sub><i>i</i></sub>
/ &part;<b>&sigma;</b><sub><i>k</i></sub>
<big>|</big><sub><b>&sigma;</b>=
                 <b>&sigma;</b><sub><b>0</b></sub></sub>
</center>
where <b>&sigma;</b><sub><b>0</b></sub> is the "background"
conductivity around which small changes are assumed to occur.
In EIDORS3D, the Jacobian is calculated using <tt>calc_jacobian</tt>;
this function needs as parameters the FEM model <tt>fem</tt>,
of type <tt>fwd_model</tt>
and the image of the background <tt>img_bkgnd</tt>
of type <tt>image</tt>.
Each of these parameters is defined to be an <tt>eidors_obj</tt>
structure, with 
the following properties.

             (v<sub>i</sub>&minus;v<sub>h</sub>)/v<sub>h</sub>?

        <p><b>Methods</b>:

        Calculate data object:
        <br>
        <i>usage:</i><tt>
          data = fwd_solve( fwd_model, image )
        </tt>

        <li><tt>fwd_model.jacobian
        </tt> &nbsp; &nbsp;

        <i>usage:</i><tt>

        </tt>
      </ul>

  <li> <b> Data Format
       </b>
</ul>

In order to create the a homogeneous background image, the
following code is used:
<ul><pre>
homg_conductivity= ones( length(fem.elems) ,1);
img_bkgnd= eidors_obj('image', 'homog background', ...
  'elem_data', homg_conductivity, 'fwd_model', fem );
</pre></ul>
where <tt>fem</tt> is a <tt>fwd_model</tt> on which the 
Jacobian is calculated. The string "homog background" is
the <i>name</i> of the object, and may be arbitrary.

<h3> Usage Examples
</h3>

<ul>
  <li> <b> Usage Example: 
       </b>
  This example shows how to test EIT image reconstructions from 
  two different algorithms on a given data set.

  <li> <b> Inverse Models:
       </b>
  This example shows how modify an existing algorithm to test the
  effect of a modification. In this example, we wish to modify the
  hyperparameter selection strategy of Polydorides (2002) to use
  instead the <i>Noise Figure</i> parameter introduced by
  Adler and Guardo.
