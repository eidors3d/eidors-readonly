EIDORS3D is a software suite for image reconstruction in
electrical impedance tomography and diffuse optical tomography.
The original EIDORS software is based on software
from Kuopio (Vaukhonen 1997).
In order to provide 3D software capability, a new project, EIDORS3D,
was begun based on the thesis of Polydorides (2002).
In the three years since the publication of EIDORS3D, several patterns
of use have been noted.
Because of lack of a modular software structure of EIDORS3D,
changes tended to made into the code itself. This resulted in
duplicated
code which could not easily be <i>modularized</i> in order to
be contributed back to EIDORS3D. Also, as recent work has begun to move
away from basic reconstruction algorithms, focussing
on such issues as mesh generation, electrode modelling, visualization
and electrode error detection. This research would be facilitated
by using modular components which could be <i>plugged</i> into
a selection of reconstruction algorithms.
</p>
<p>To address these issues, EIDORS3D has been restructured
in order to facilitate a <i>community-based extensible software base</i>.
This has been accomplished by the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Sourceforge hosting </b> EIDORS3D is hosted by <tt>sourceforge.net</tt>
at <tt>eidors3d.sf.net</tt>. This tool allows for collaborative
development for group members, while permitting all users to access the
code. </li>
  <li> <b> Language independance: Octave and Matlab </b> While
EIDORS3D was originally written for Matlab, the eventual goal is for
language independance. Currently EIDORS works with Octave (version &ge;
2.1.66) and Matlab (version &ge; 6.0). </li>
  <li> <b> Pluggable code base </b> "Pluggable" software allows users
to modify functions by adding new modules, without
needing to make changes to the underlying code. This offers similar
capabilities to an object oriented implementation, although it was been
instead implemented using function pointers. </li>
  <li> <b> Automatic value caching </b> In order to increase
performance of image reconstruction software, it is important to cache
computationally expensive variables, such as the Jacobian. Such caching
complicates the software implementation. To solve this problem,
EIDORS3D extracts caching to a separate module which is inhereted by
each functional module. </li>
  <li> <b> Generalized data formats </b> In order to support the wide
variety of EIT measurements and algorithms, a general EIT data format
structure is developed. </li>
  <li> <b> Interface software for common EIT systems </b> Functions
to load data from some common EIT systems to the generalized data
format have been developed. </li>
  <li> <b> Usage examples </b> Some simple and more complex usage
examples are provided. </li>
  <li> <b> Open-source license </b> EIDORS3D is licenced under the
GNU General Public License. Uses are free to use, modify, and
distribute their modifications. All modifications must include the
source code, or instructions on how to obtain it. EIDORS3D may be used
in a commercial product, as long as the source code for EIDORS and all
modifications to it are made available.
  </li>
</ul>
We hope that by providing a structure for community collaboration
in EIT algorithms we can produce robust,
reliable and fairly portable software which draws on our collective
expertise and facilitates innovations in the field.
