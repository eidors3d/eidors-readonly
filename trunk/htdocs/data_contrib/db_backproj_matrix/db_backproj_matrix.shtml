       <td> 
There are several different versions of the backprojection
algorithm in existence. The one made available here is
the version distributed with the Sheffield Mk I system,
and is very similar to the algorithm distributed with 
the G&ouml;ttingen Goe MF II EIT system. Almost all clinical
and experimental publications which mention "backprojection"
use the version of the algorithm provided here. The
paper which probably best describes this algorithm
is
