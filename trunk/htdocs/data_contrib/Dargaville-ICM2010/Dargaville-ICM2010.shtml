       <td> 
The measurements were performed in two piglets (g08 and g10) during baseline conditions in healthy lung (g08-c003.get, g10-c003.get), after induction of acute lung injury by repeated bronchoalveolar lavage (g08-c017.get, g10-c019.get) and after administration of surfactant (g08-c035.get, g10-c029.get) during pressure-controlled ventilation. The EIT raw data were acquired during an incremental and decremental PEEP trial (stepwise increase and decrease of positive end-expiratory pressure from 0 cm H2O to 25 cm H2O and back) at a rate of 13 frames/s. Each measurement lasted 180 s. The excitation current was 70 kHz.
