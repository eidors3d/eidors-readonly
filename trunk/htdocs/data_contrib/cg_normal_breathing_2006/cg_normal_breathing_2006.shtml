% THE EXPERIMENT
% ****************************
Subject: Camille Gomez-Laberge
Age: 25
Status: Healthy
Experimenter: Li Peng Xie
Date Collected: September 15, 2005
Locale: Research laboratory
Equipment: EIT Viasys / University of Gottingen
Electrodes: 17 EKG Blue Sensor Ag/Ag-Cl electrodes (16 + reference)
Skin Preparation: Rubbing alcohol
Measurement Procedure: All measurements are taken while the subject is
supine. Ambient temperature in room is 25 degrees Celcius. Details for
each part of the experiment follow.

PART I:
Directory: cgomez-1pl/
Placement: Single plane 16 electrodes aligned with the fifth rib directly
below the nipple. Electrode 1 is in the centre of the sternum. The other
electrodes are labelled moving towards the subject's right side so that
electrode 5 in under the right armpit, electrode 9 on the spine and
electrode 13 under the left armpit. The reference electrode is placed
on the right side of the subject's waist line.

Subject is rested - in normal state

1. Tidal breathing
Heart rate: 62 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t1_001.get
Note: Measurement begins when lungs are at functional residual capacity.

2. Total Lung Capacity - Residual Capacity (TLC-RC)
Heart rate: 62 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t1_002.get
Note: Measurement begins when lungs are at residual capacity.

3. Paradoxial Breathing
Heart rate: 62 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t1_003.get
Note: Subject is holding breath and transfering air across thorax by
expanding the rib cage and then expanding the abdomen. This is repeated
every 5 seconds for the duration of the sample.

Subject induces stress on the cardiovascular system by lower-body
excercise (e.g running, climbing stairs).
Subject ran until heartrate exceeded 90 bpm (approx. 6 minutes in this case).
NOTE: The electrodes are not removed during excercise.

4. Tidal breathing
Heart rate: 92 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t1_004.get
Note: Measurement begins when lungs are at functional residual capacity.

5. TLC-RC
Heart rate: 90 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t1_005.get
Note: Measurement begins when lungs are at residual capacity.

6. Paradoxial Breathing
Heart rate: 84 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t1_006.get
Note: Subject is holding breath and transfering air across thorax by
expanding the rib cage and then expanding the abdomen. This is repeated
every 5 seconds for the duration of the sample.

Measurement Procedure: All measurements are taken while the subject is
supine. Ambient temperature in room is 25 degrees Celcius. Details for
each part of the experiment follow.

PART II:
Directory: cgomez-2pl/
Placement: Two planes of 8 electrodes each. The upper plane is vertically
aligned with the fifth (5) rib directly below the nipple and the lower
plane with the seventh (7) rib directly below the nipple. Electrode 1
is on the upper plane in the centre of the sternum. Electrode 2 is on
the lower plane but shifted to the right by half the inter-electrode
distance on the upper plane. The other electrodes are labelled in a
zig-zag pattern, moving towards the subject's right side. The reference
electrode is placed on the right side of the subject's waist line.

Subject is rested - in normal state

1. Tidal breathing
Heart rate: 58 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t2_001.get
Note: Measurement begins when lungs are at functional residual capacity.

2. Total Lung Capacity - Residual Capacity (TLC-RC)
Heart rate: 64 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t2_002.get
Note: Measurement begins when lungs are at residual capacity.

3. Paradoxial Breathing
Heart rate: 60 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t2_003.get
Note: Subject is holding breath and transfering air across thorax by
expanding the rib cage and then expanding the abdomen. This is repeated
every 5 seconds for the duration of the sample. Measurement begins with
abdomen expanded.

Subject induces stress on the cardiovascular system by lower-body
excercise (e.g running, climbing stairs).

Subject ran until heartrate exceeded 90 bpm (approx. 6 minutes in this case).
NOTE: The electrodes are not removed during excercise.

4. Tidal breathing
Heart rate: 102 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t2_004.get
Note: Measurement begins when lungs are at functional residual capacity.

5. TLC-RC
Heart rate: 96 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t2_005.get
Note: Measurement begins when lungs are at residual capacity.

6. Paradoxial Breathing
Heart rate: 76 bpm
Data file: vivo150905_t2_006.get
Note: Subject is holding breath and transfering air across thorax by
expanding the rib cage and then expanding the abdomen. This is repeated
every 5 seconds for the duration of the sample. Measurement begins with
abdomen expanded.
