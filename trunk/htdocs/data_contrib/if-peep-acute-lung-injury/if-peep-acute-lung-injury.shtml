       <td> 
The measurements were performed in the same pig after induction of
acute lung injury by repeated bronchoalveolar lavage (p1130107.get) and
after administration of surfactant (p1130122.get). Both measurements
were acquired at a rate of 13 scans/s, a total of 1500 frames were
obtained. The excitation current was 50 kHz. The data was acquired
during an incremental and decremental PEEP trial (stepwise increase and
decrease of positive end-expiratory pressure).
