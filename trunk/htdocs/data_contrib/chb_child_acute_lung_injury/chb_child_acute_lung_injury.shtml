EIT Recording of a child (25kg) with Acute Lung Injury on conventional ventilation. Recording includes suctioning maneuvers. Provided are: 30s reference measurement CHB_CONV05-ref.* and a 5min intervention measurement CHB_CONV05.* with the following interventions:
<pre>
	0%		start measurement, conventional ventilation
	10%		saline instillation
	11%		ventilation continued
	18%		suction catheter inserted
	23%		suctioning, patient coughing
	26%		end of suctioning
	40%		saline instillation
	52%		suction catheter inserted
	56%		suctioning
	59%		end of suctioning
	69%		suction catheter inserted
	71%		suctioning
	76%		end of suctioning
	100%		end of measurement
	[percentage refers to total measurement time]
	
Ventilator settigns:
	PIP		18
	PEEP		7
	MAP		12
	RR		12
	FIO2		60%
	Tidal volume 	8.2ml/kg
</pre>	
Heart rate (as measured during reference measurement, 30 min before intervention): 135 bpm
