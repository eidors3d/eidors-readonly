Instructions for interpretation of EIT Data Files from the Rensselaer EIT Group
</b> </center>
<p>
There are five files provided in this collection, together with these
instructions.  They consist of one file of excitation currents, two
voltage files of a homogeneous tank and two voltage files with agar
targets placed in that tank shortly thereafter.  The two voltage files
in each case consist of a set of real voltages and a set of quadrature
voltages.  The nomenclature is <tt>ACT2006i.txt</tt>
denotes the homogeneous tank,
and <tt>ACT2000i.txt</tt> denotes the tank with targets. 
I=r are real voltages,
i=q are quadrature.

<p>
The system used to produce these data is ACT 3, as described in:
<ul>
 Edic, P.M., G.J. Saulnier, J.C. Newell and D. Isaacson.
"A real-time electrical impedance tomograph."
<i>IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng.</i> 42(9):849-859, 1995. PMID = 7558059.
</ul>
It applies currents and reads voltages on 32 electrodes
simultaneously, operating at 28.8 kHz.

<p>
The format of all five of these files is the same.  The voltage files
have a single first line that denotes the maximum amplitude of the
applied currents.  The next 992 lines follow the same format as the 992
lines in the current file. The current file is called ssoout1.dat, a name
invented by Steve Simske in the late 1980's.  The following description
applies to the common format.  There are 992 lines (=32&times;31). There are
32 electrodes and 31 current patterns.  The electrodes are numbered
consecutively from the +x axis counterclockwise, 32 is on the +x axis.
The first 32 lines in the file constitute the first current pattern, and
they specify the currents on the 32 electrodes.  They are given by I = cos
(&theta;). The next 32 lines are pattern 2, and may be described as I = cos
(2&times;&theta;). What follows are current patterns up to I = cos (16&times;&theta;).
That takes 32&times;16=512 lines. 
 At line 513, a new pattern begins given by
I = sin (&theta;). This continues for 15 patterns, from I = sin (&theta;) to
I = sin (15&times;&theta;).  There are thus 31 (orthogonal) patterns of applied
current. A more rigorous definition of the applied current patterns is
given in Eqn. 12 in the paper cited below.

<p>
The agar targets in ACT2000 resemble two lungs and a heart.  The physical
properties of the tank and the phantom are as reported in
<ul>
 Isaacson, D.,
J.L. Mueller, J.C. Newell and S. Siltanen. "Reconstructions of chest
phantoms by the d-bar method for electrical impedance tomography." <i>IEEE
Trans Med Imaging</i> 23(7): 821-828, 2004.
</ul>
 The tank is 30 cm in diameter;
the electrodes are 1.6 cm high by 2.5 cm wide.  The saline conductivity
was 424 mS/m.  The agar targets of the "lungs" had a conductivity of
240 mS/m, and the "heart" was 750 mS/m.

<center> <b>Caution</b> </center>

<p>
It is possible to use this data, measured with Trigonometric current
patterns, to computationally synthesize data that could in theory result
from other current patterns, such as the adjacent pair excitation,
or opposite pair excitation.  In doing so, the synthesized data would
have greater accuracy, distinguishability, and information about the
conductivity inside the body, because it would have more digits and less
error, than would be expected from a data acquisition system that applied
and measured these other current patterns directly. This is because the
trigonometric patterns have more information about the conductivity in
their measured digits or bits than the other patterns would typically
contain in the same number of measured digits or bits.  The synthesis
process uses many more digits than the measuring process and thus the
information in the trigonometric patterns can be transferred to many
more digits of the synthesized data than would typically be able to be
measured by systems using these other patterns of currents directly. This
is a subtle point, since the principle of superposition does not hold
when finite precision arithmetic is used, but it motivates our use of
ACT type systems. For this reason caution should be used in comparing the
results from different reconstruction algorithms and systems, recognizing
that these synthesized data sets might have misleadingly low errors.
