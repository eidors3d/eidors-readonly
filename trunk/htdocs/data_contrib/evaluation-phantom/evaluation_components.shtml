Test Overview:
</h2>
<p>To evaluate 
and compare the performance of a complete EIT system, we proposed a test 
methodology and phantom system design based on reproducible procedures with 
completely characterized and traceable test objects. Components of system 
performance evaluation are shown in figure 1: </p>

proposed test setup and procedure to evaluate EIT system performance

<p>
An EIT system consists of an electrode 
interface, EIT stimulation and measurement hardware and an image reconstruction 
algorithm. Measurements are performed using a specified 
measurement protocol and characterized traceable test objects.The data and images are systematically 
analysed by performance analysis algorithm. 

<p>
Evaluation procedure:
<p>
Three important components for 
this test are test phantoms, a test protocol, and evaluation 
methodology/software. The EIT system is connected to the 
phantom, and three sets of measurements are performed:

<ol>
<li> Homogeneous tank measurements, designed to evaluate system noise, 
accuracy, drift and symmetric measurement electrodes.
<li> Measurements with one conductivity contrast which is moved horizontally 
at several vertical offsets from the electrode plane, designed to measure 
amplitude response, position accuracy, resolution, and detectability limits;
<li>
Measurements with two conductivity contrasts, designed to measure limits 
of distinguishability of contrasts.The position of two objects highly 
affected the image reconstruction where two closely positioned objects look like 
a bigger single object.

Performance parameters:
</h2>
A set of parameters is proposed:
<ul><table>
   <tr><th>A.
       <td> data and image noise, and data accuracy,
   <tr><th>B.
       <td>
detectability and distinguishability of single and multiple contrasts, 
and
   <tr><th>C.
       <td>
Accuracy of reconstructed images.
</table></ul>
which correspond to the block diagram:

block is for detectability of a single target and distinguishability of two

The calculation of these figures of 
merit is illustrated in figure below:

<p>
For better performance, it is 
desirable for AR, PE and RES to be constant, while PE, RES and RNG should be as 
small as possible for any target position.
