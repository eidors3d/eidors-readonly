<p>
The examples 
and demos show how the algorithms for the evaluation of EIT performance based on 
pre-measured data. Simulated demo is also provided for image analysis in 2D and 
3D (Detectability and GREIT parameters) in next section. To evaluate any EIT 
system, the user can define what type of evaluation they want to do after 
placing the measured data to a proper directory or modifying the directory 
locations in the code. Simulated tutorial for image analysis is provided in next 
section.

<p>Download the algorithms in a zip file and then unzip it.
<p>Main folders: EIT_system_evaluation consists of following 4 
subfolders: code, data, documents and figures.
Data repository: We created folders to store the data under 
the data folder which include accuracy, drift, detectability (1 object) and 
distinguishability (2 objects) subfolders.

<p>
<a name="Guide"><H3>Guide to evaluation algorithm:</H3></a>
The main 
evaluation algorithm consists of following 3 sub-algorithms:

<ol>
	<li>data_analysis.m
	<li>drift_analysis.m
	<li>image_analysis.m
</ol>

<p>Note:drift analyses 
takes long time to to be processed (~20-30 min depending on the PC specification) so a separate 
sub-function is provided out of data analysis algorithm. 

The algorithm is provided for 
data and drift analysis below with pre-measured data. The measures for the 
accuracy and symmetric 
electrode measurement calculated based on mean values of multiple measurements 
for each position.

		<li>Accuracy
		<li>Reciprocity Accuracy
		<li><b>File name:</b>data_analysis.m<li>
		<b>Usage:</b>[snr, accuracy,sym_err]= data_analysis(Reshape);&nbsp; 
		For example,<i>[snr, accuracy,sym_err]= data_analysis(0)</i>
	</ul>
	
<p>Reshape is a status/input parameter used 
to check if reshape of signal from U-shape to plateau signal shape is needed or not 
- 0 not needed, 1 needed. To perform data 
analysis, the measurement sequence may need to be rearranged to be consistent 
with the presentation of the results. Measured and simulated voltages need to 
have plateau signal shape form for ease of analysis as figure (A) (<a href="#Formation_of_plateau_signal_shape">to 
get plateau signal shape</a>). If the voltage sequence is based on U-shape 
signal (the Sheffield 
measurement sequence or the sequence of measurement followed by the injecting 
electrodes) as figure (B) or&nbsp; , the algorithm will reshape the signal using
<i><a href="#sin2plateau.m">U2plateau.m</a></i>.

</h4>

	<ul>
		<li> File name:</b> <i>drift_analysis.m</i>
		<li> Usage:[Df]=drift_analysis
	</ul>
<p> Users have to check several parameters if it matches what they measured to the default values 
that are defined in the code like number of frames, number of data points for 
each frame, and measurement sequences. <b>Input:</b> <i>nframes</i> is the 
number of frames for drift measurement; <i>nmeas</i> is number of measurements 
for each frame (mostly 208, in some cases 416). The output value is the values of Allan 
variance.

</h4>

<ul>
<li>File name : <i>image_analysis.m</i>
<li>Usage: <i>[DET, greit_para] = image_analysis</i>, this function computes and plots following measures as output:

	<ul>
		<li> Detectability
		<li> Distinguishability
		<li> Amplitude response (AR)
		<li> Position error (PE)
		<li> Resolution (RES)
		<li> Shape deformation (SD)
		<li> Ringing (RNG)
	</ul>

<p> To have a measurement sequence with a <b> plateau signal shape </b> please look at Figure 10 
of&nbsp; paper <b>source:</b> Gagnon H, Cousineau M, Adler A, Hartinger A

	<ul>
		<li> U2plateau.m </i>converts Sheffield voltage measurement sequence (input) to plateau shape (output) described above.
		<li> Usage: <i>[Vp]= U2plateau(V)</i>
		<li> V should be based on U-shape (Sheffield voltage measurement sequence 
		or the measurement sequence followed by the injecting electrodes), 
		produce plateau shaped wave form (Vp)
