       <td> 
The <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=48.008182,-1.710085&z=18">Pont Pean</a>
was an important silver mine before it flooded in April 1, 1904. Historical information
is explained can be found at 
<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont-P%C3%A9an">fr.Wikipedia.org</a> and
<a href="http://www.galene.fr/">galene.fr</a>. Due to the regular geophysical
geometries of the site, and the large conductivity contrast of the ore with
the surrounding rock, it represents an excellent test site for geophysical EIT
measurements. These data were measured by a team of geophysical researchers
at Universit&eacute; Rennes 1 over the period 2000&minus;2011.

       <td>
EIT data were acquired with the a ABEM SAS 4000 Resistivity Meter, and
an electrode selector ES 464. 64 stainless steel (approx 20&nbsp;cm long and
1&nbsp;cm diameter) electrodes were placed in a single line along the side of the road
<i>La Grand Betuaudais</i> in Pont P&eacute;an, France. Electrodes were typically
spaced 5&nbsp;m apart and a reference electrode was sometimes placed at &infin;
(1&nbsp;km west of the site). Detailed electrode positions are in the data files.
Current levels between 100&nbsp;mA and 200&nbsp;mA were used (using a low frequency
square wave current waveform).
