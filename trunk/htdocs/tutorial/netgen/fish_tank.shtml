<h2> 
View of an electric fish in a tank
</h2>

Weakly electric fish use EIT to see their environment.
Since they generate current (from head to tail) we can
view them with other electrodes.
The idea of this tutorial is to simulate a fish in tank,
and then to see the world from their perspective (ie
the voltage distribution on the body of the fish. 


<h3>
Model a 3D tank with 8 electrodes and an elliptical fish

<h3>
Create stim_patterns and meas_patterns for the fish

Solve for the voltage distribution in the tank
