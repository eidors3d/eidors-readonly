<h2>News</h2>
This page is a list of updates, discussions, and 
ideas for enhancements to the
EIDORS-3D package. Not all ideas will be implmeneted,
of course, but at least they're written down.
<ul>
<br><li><b>
    23 June 2004: Discussion
</b> W.R.B. Lionheart, A. Adler
In order to further EIDORS development, we developed the
following desirata for EIDORS software.
<ul>
    <li> <b>
        API design
    </b><br>
    EIDORS needs a clean, well-encapsulated and easy to understand
    API. We do not feel that an object oriented API is particularly
    useful because:
    1) the Matlab OO design is somewhat of a "hack"
    2) such an OO interface would make portability to other 
       languages less easy

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Language portability
    </b><br>
    EIDORS is primarily aimed at MATLAB. We would like to EIDORS
    to support Octave and Scilab, as far as possible. Currently,
    Octave and Scilab have the features needed by EIDORS (sparse
    matrices, 3D matrix support, etc.)
    <p>
    In the core, it should be possible to have portability. However,
    Matlab graphics features are not supported in these languages.
    Our idea is therefore to separate the graphics functions
    from the core code. Graphics code would therefore be permitted
    to be language specific.
    <p>
    Another desirable feature would be to support approaches
    to enhance execution speed: ie. C functions, multiprocessor
    support, etc. This is dealt with under <i>plug-in algorithms</i>


    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Plugin algorithms
    </b><br>
    Many users will want to use EIDORS infrastructure to test their
    own ideas. EIDORS should support <i>plugging in</i> such new
    algorithms or techniques. 
    <p>
    It is not obvious to us at this point exactly what features
    need to be added. Thus is is likely that some refactoring
    of the code will be required as we learn more about users needs.
    Please contact the authors with suggestions.

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Reference algorithms
    </b><br>
    One of the main goals of EIDORS is to allow people to compare
    their <i>new fangled algorithms</i> to those implemented by others.
    Unfortunately, the typical approach in this field has been to 
    compare the <i>new fangled</i> to badly implement versions 
    of others.
    Ideally, EIDORS will make it easy to do the comparison 
    correctly, <i>if desired</i>.
    <p>
    EIDORS should therefore offer:
    1) use of the <i>latest  and greatest</i>
        algorithms,
        and
    2) use of specific algorithms corresponding to
        specific papers

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Simple and transparent code-base
    </b><br>
    EIDORS code is primarily aimed at numerical researchers.
    This means EIDORS should be:
    <br>&minus; simple. Code should be sufficiently small for 
        an interested person to learn quite quickly
    <br>&minus; command line based. Code should expose it's capabilities
        and internal structure for inclusion into other algorithms.
        Graphic interface contributions will be accepted, but will
        be placed outside of the core.
    <br>&minus; modifiable. Many users will want to modify EIDORS
        to try their own ideas. This should be reasonably easy
        to do.
    <br>&minus;
