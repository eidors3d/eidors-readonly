This directory contains some files to help make meshes with
Netgen http://www.hpfem.jku.at/netgen/

tankmodel.m generates a netgen constructive solid geometry file
of a cylinder with hemispheres intersected to make electrodes
(not the best way to add electrodes but it works). Its a script so editto change no of electrodes etc.

This can be meshed with netgen, and the resulting mesh saved in 'Neutral' format, which is easy to read in Matlab. 

readngneutral.m is a function to read the neutral file in to arrays
