This directory contains some files to help make meshes with
Netgen http://www.hpfem.jku.at/netgen/

create_tank_mesh_ng_interactive.m  generates a netgen constructive solid geometry file
of a cylinder with rectangular or circular electrodes.

create_tank_mesh_ng.m  is the function version.




ng_read_mesh is a function for reading netgen meshes in to (old) eidors format

ng_tank_find_elec.m automatically finds where the electrodes are based on where we put them

its a bit falible as its based on the centre of mass of the electrodes.

ng_tank_select_elec.m is an interactive version that displays faces and asks if they are electrodes.
