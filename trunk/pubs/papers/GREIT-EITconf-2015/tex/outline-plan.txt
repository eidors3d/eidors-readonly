OUTLINE:
  - 3D formulation
  - New desired solution / target distributions
  - Amplitude Response scaling
  - Results / Links to results


Notes 04/05/2015
 - big object artefacts out-of-plane
 - need experience interpreting 3D images
 -- different resolution in each direction
 -- voxels are better than tets
 -- GREIT FOM need to be modified
 - curse of dimensionality
 - display
 -- DICOM ??
 -- how to show results to the doctors
 -- real-time?
 - do we need new fEIT measures?
 - 3D EIT is essential for sitting patients
 - horizontal v. vertical resolution ??
 - can 3D approach help in 2D electrode configs?
 - are 2x16 electrodes better than 1x32 in terms of FOM
 PLAN:
 - BJG: set-up an svn for the presentation
 - BMU: record data when back from holidays (After May 18)
 - start in 2 weeks
 Q: how many voxel layers?
