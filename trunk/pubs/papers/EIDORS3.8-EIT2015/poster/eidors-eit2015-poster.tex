%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Release 3.8 of EIDORS builds upon a strong foundation in reconstruction
algorithms, adding and improving a number of aspects.
\begin{enumerate}
\item More stable
  iterative absolute inverse solvers (both Gauss-Newton and
  Conjugate-Gradient).
% DEPENDS ON ABS SOLVER

\item Greater flexibility in parametrization choices.
% DEPENDS ON ABS SOLVER

\item Native handling of unit scaling ($10^x$, $e^x$, $\ln x$, $\log_{10} x$),
 and arbitrary units.
% resistivity/conductivity, and apparent resistivity conversions.
  Natural limits for $\sigma > 0$. %~\cite{polydorides2014}.
% A framework for alternate arbitrary units.
%  Support for transparent usage in forward solutions and
%  Jacobian calculations.
% DEPENDS ON ABS SOLVER

\item GREIT reconstructions in 3D

\item Speed optimizations: improved Jacobian calculation, faster cache handling, and 
% Improvements to {\tt stim\_meas\_list} generated structures, resulting in
  faster forward solutions.
%  Also, the ability to
%  convert between a stimulus structure and a list of stimulus and measurement electrode pairs.
% An implementation of the parallel Jacobian calculator (pending MEX issues).

%\item Attempts to work around broken matlab MEX file handling (cross-platform mex compile).

\item Improved interfaces to NetGen and visualization.
      Compound and point electrodes in NetGen.

\item Analytic calculation of dual-mesh interpolations (coarse to fine)
% as well as, Quad and hex shaped mesh elements %rev 4392

\item Support for second and third order mesh elements.

\item Support for Dr\"ager and Swisstom file formats
%\item OpenEIT file format support~\cite{jones2014}.

\item Expanded shape library

  \headerbox{Successes}{name=sensitivity,column=1,below=problem}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The structure of EIDORS has been relatively stable due, in part, to some early design choices:
a modular framework and data structure,
cross-platform support, integration of meshing,
tutorials, and the contributed data repository.
These aspects, along with an open source code-base, have enabled EIDORS to
maintain research relevance.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\headerbox{Challenges}{name=specificity,column=2,below=problem,bottomaligned=sensitivity}{
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A number of challenges inherent in the implementation of EIDORS as a Matlab-based toolkit continue to recur.
There is no real Object Oriented framework: no reflection, protection, or
  automatic management of errors.
Versions of Matlab frequently vary in confounding ways that make
  maintaining a toolkit across multiple Matlab versions difficult. This is
  particularly prevalent for Windows users and ``mex" file compilation.
The data structure and subfunction complexity in EIDORS are a
  source of confusion for beginners.
% and a challenge to manage for developers.
%The expansion of EIDORS into new application domains continues to provide software development challenges at times.
%Despite this, or indeed because of this, 
Despite these challenges, EIDORS continues to develop and grow: presenting version 3.8!
