function [srf] = dubs3_2(tri)
% Usage: [srf] = dubs3_2(tri);
%
% General:
% Auxiliary function that extract the boundary faces of a given 3D volume (faster than the original dubs3.m)
%
% Input: 
% tri - simplices matrix {k x 4}
%
% Output:
% srf - outer boundary surfaces {no. of external surfaces x 3}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% create a list of all element facetts & sort
