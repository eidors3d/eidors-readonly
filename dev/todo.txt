EIDORS:TODO
 - deform_cylinder - use proper fit like a fourier fit.
 - mk_c2f_circ_mapping - not quite right fitting
 - move np stuff to background. Change aa to the defaults.
 - unit_test_cmp - print tolerance of comparison

 - add_noise - work for matrix noise
             - then update temporal_solver01

 - merge choose_imdl
 - \ => forward_solver
 - library_model => accept simulation
 - BG's colourbar
 - ng_mk_closed_contour - rename + make tutorial
 - unify the 'extra' code handing in ng_mk ...
 - move absolute tutorials into functions in main code

 - migrate aa_fwd_parameters to fix_model
 - fix_model should accept options
 - see if we need bs_calc_system_mat
 - see if we need object_in_tank_2d
 - see if we need examples, or move to tutorials

 - fix gaussian_HPF_prior
     - work in 3D like laplace_image_prior

 - remove examples and integrate with tutorials

===================
Problems with calc_move_jacobian.m - only with 3D models
===================
Cleanup calc_colours to clean up handling of image_field
   parameter.
  - code also in eidors_colours, scale_for_display, 
  - probably need new colourbar functions
===================
