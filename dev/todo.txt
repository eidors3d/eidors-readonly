EIDORS:TODO
 - deform_cylinder - use proper fit like a fourier fit.
 - mk_c2f_circ_mapping - not quite right fitting
 - move np stuff to background. Change aa to the defaults.
 - unit_test_cmp - print tolerance of comparison

 - add_noise - work for matrix noise
             - then update temporal_solver01

 - merge choose_imdl
 - \ => forward_solver
 - library_model => accept simulation
 - BG's colourbar
 - ng_mk_closed_contour - rename + make tutorial
 - unify the 'extra' code handing in ng_mk ...
 - move absolute tutorials into functions in main code

 - migrate aa_fwd_parameters to fix_model
 - fix_model should accept options
 - see if we need bs_calc_system_mat
 - see if we need object_in_tank_2d
 - see if we need examples, or move to tutorials

 - fix gaussian_HPF_prior
     - work in 3D like laplace_image_prior

 - remove examples and integrate with tutorials

===================
Problems with calc_move_jacobian.m - only with 3D models
===================
Cleanup calc_colours to clean up handling of image_field
   parameter.
  - code also in eidors_colours, scale_for_display, 
  - probably need new colourbar functions
===================
ng_mk_ ... models
  - put in unit test code
  - allow each to call with multiple extra parameters
  - start to refactor electrode code
==================
noser_image_prior
  - may fail on this line (change in spdiags in new matlab)
    Reg = spdiags( diag_col.^exponent, 0, l_prior, l_prior);
=================
There is an inconsistency between
   mk_grid_models - which has its own pixels
and
   calc_slices - which does its own interpolation
Generally, this means that the pictures from calc_slices
are even smoother than they should be. 

also show_slices is crufty
% TODO: because we wanted (back in 2005) to let show_slices
% handle lots of different scenarios (calling with images and
% without. It is now crufty ... and should be changed.
=================
one important feature would be to add code introspection.
This would allow you to know if a given algorithm can support
   linear reconstruction, etc.

One way to enfore this is to add modes to every piece of code
   function('UNIT_TEST')
   function('CAPABILITY_LIST')
etc.

     - default, but let users choose where to cache

   eidors/deprecated
     - functions named for particular people (aa, np, etc)

 NOT THE PATH:
   eidors/compatibility
     - compatibility for old eidors code. Stuff that has
       was taken out of deprecated. (not for 3.6)

   eidors/tests 
   dev/name
    - place for work before it moves to release
    - here we have individually named directories
   htdocs/ ...
