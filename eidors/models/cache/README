This file contains a number of useful netgen models for use
with EIDORS. It is not strictly necessary; EIDORS will automatically
generate these files as requested. However, these models are
very computationally expensive to create, and require a 
computer with lots of memory (at least 8GB).

To allow EIDORS to use these models, unzip the file into
a path (for example /path/to/models or C:/path/to/models)
and run
   mk_library_model('LIBRARY_PATH','/path/to/models');
after startup.

The default location for these models is
   /path/to/eidors/models/cache
if the models are placed there, the above command is 
unnecessary.
