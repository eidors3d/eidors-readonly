This is EIDORS v3.7. The eidors-v3.7.zip file
contains all code and documentation to run EIDORS.

Additionally, you can download the model_library.zip
file, which contains precalculated additional finite
element models for use with EIDORS.  The model_library.zip
file is not necessary, EIDORS will recalculate these
models if they are not available.

    (windows >>run C:/path/to/eidors/startup.m)
