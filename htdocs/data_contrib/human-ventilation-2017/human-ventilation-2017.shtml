   <tr><th valign="top"> Brief Description:
       <td> 
These data are a brief sample of breathing in a healthy
human, tested by Swisstom AG as part of system evaluation.
The data represent a few tidal breaths as well as
expiratory and inspiratory breath holds.
<br>
The data were measured on the same subject as the
GREIT chest model given in this tutorial
<a href="../../tutorial/GREIT/adult_ex.shtml"
>GREIT Reconstruction for an adult human thorax geometry</a>

   <tr><th valign="top"> Methods:
       <td>
An Swisstom Patient belt was attached to
