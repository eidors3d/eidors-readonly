Five pigs before (e.g. 1-control.raw) and after induction of unilateral lung
injury 
(e.g. 1-injury.raw). Oleic acid was administered through the distal opening of a
pulmonary artery catheter placed in a branch of the left pulmonary artery.

Figure 3 (from Frerichs <i>et al</i>, 1998):
Thoracic functional EIT images before (Control) and after
the development of artificially induced left lung injury (Lung
injury) reflecting the distribution of ventilation in the five animals
studied. (The lungs are typically located in the central and ventral
parts of the thorax due to the well developed backbone musculature
in pigs.) The schematic cross-section of the pig thorax in the
left upper corner shows the spatial orientation of the images.
Each image is scaled to the individual maximum impedance variation.
The scale shows that higher local impedance variation (i.e.
higher fluctuation of regional lung volume) is represented in light
tones
