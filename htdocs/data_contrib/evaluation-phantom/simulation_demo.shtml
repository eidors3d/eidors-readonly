<h1>Simulation demo</h1>
Simulated 
tutorial is given below for the image analysis part: detectability and GREIT.

Here are 
several simulated examples for the detectability of a single object. Simulations 
are shown below for detectability analysis in 2D and 3D (sim_2D_params.m, 
sim_Det_3D.m) beside GREIT parameters for a single object in 2D

2D simulation is 
performed below for a target moving from center to the edge. This code includes 3 sub-functions: (i) Simulated voltages 
and image reconstruction, (ii) GREIT analysis, (iii) detectability for a target 
moving from center to the edge.
<p>
GREIT analysis includes the 
figures of merit based on the GREIT algorithm (Adler et al 2009) such as (1) 
amplitude response (AR), (2) position error (PE), (3) resolution (RES), (4) 
spatial distortion (SD) and (5) ringing (RNG).

For better performance, it is 
desirable for AR, PE and RES to be constant, while PE, RES and RNG should be as 
small as possible for any target position. With real-measurements, these 
parameters are calculated from an average of multiple measurements for each 
position.
