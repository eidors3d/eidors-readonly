<p>
<b>Minutes:</b>
<ol>
<li> Everyone introduced themselves

<li> It was agreed by all that the code circulated for this meeting that was not
yet released would be treated as confidential, as the authors needed a chance
to publish papers on their work first. When ready the authors can contribute
it to the eidors3d source tree on sourceforge.net either themselves or via
one one of those registered as developers.

<li> Current work in EIT and with EIDORS software was discussed.

<li> Standard file formats.<br>
(AA) As we develop project we have a chance to set a standard.
<br>

(RB) Kevin Boon suggested standard data format in Ankara. Confidential medical
data, patient owns it.
Community has to be seen to respect medical data (eg name prognosis.). Phantom
data not an issue. Cant just send a data file. Issue about type of system.
Collection protocol, dynamic range, data scaling. Electrode placement within
error. In real data another level, may need to preprocess to data.
Do we want EIDORS to be a teaching tool or a more advanced tool.
Reverse is to say what syntax EIDORS needs.
<br>

(RB) Image format. SPN, statistical parametric modelling. What is output
format.  VTK?
30 Images different freq. Need for comparison of data.
<br>


(AA) Symantic difficulty, cond on vertices, elements, mapping to cut planes.
So what is image? Rasterizing.
<br>


(NP) Test set for others to compare. Dist with EIDORS.
<br>


(RB) OT, see Martin Schweiger's web site at UCL.
There is lots of error checking in TOAST. This can be an issue when trying to
adapt the code to a different application.
<br>


(AA) Defining a new standard would raise political issues. On the other hand,
simply saying that "this is what you need to work with EIDORS" is easier.
<br>


<i>Action</i>: AA -- consult  OT people (HD). Check with RB for head, JLD for Process
Tomography.
<br>

Models meshes -- standard file formats. Can we use standard ones? Iges, EDS,
Universal File Format,
SLT (parametric surface).

Mesh quality factors.
<br>

<li>  (AA) API and plugable algorithms.
<br>

Want to easily plug in new idea and compare with named reference algorithms.
API written so this is easy but also safe.
<br>

(RB) Grid algorithms, multiple self contained program, moduarity.
<br>

<li>   CVS version on source forge.
<br>
Octave compatible using if statements to bypass matlab graphics.
Matlab OO. Not well written. Use structures instead

<br>&minus;<i>
data </i> - measurements, units, time, comment,
              electrode positions, current pattern

<br>&minus;<i>
fwd_model</i> - FEM, electrode posn. and models,
        excitation / meas. patterns, electrode models

<br>&minus;<i>
inv_model</i> - hyperparameters, pointers to code

<br>&minus;<i>
image</i> - image data, pointers to fwd_model, inv_model


<br>    Basic Methods:
<br>&minus;
fwd_solve, inv_solve, jacobian, etc.
<br>&minus;
methods call alg. specific
<br>&minus;
'centralized' caching to avoid repeat calcs

Demo_real modified on CVS tree to do this.
<br>

Discussion on packing un packing
<br>
AA explained the "copy on write" issue in matlab. If you assign one big array
to another it does not make a copy until you assign to the old one. Care is
needed to avoid meemory bloat.
<br>

DS and LH wondered whether this structure is appropriate for computationally
intensive problems.
<br>

<i>Action</i> LH and DS to look at AA's structures and see how it would suit their problems.

<br>

(WL) Are we prepared to make big changes now, such as changes to variable
names.
Yes, as long as we carry the main users with us. Proposed major changes will
be discussed on eidors-3d listserv.

<br>


<li> Research Issues
(RB) Cross continent funding? Grid computing -- no real applications?
"e-science community"
<br>

Action: AA to check on Canadian position.
RB To check on Grid stuff. Large computing, para'l computing.
<br>

(AA) Testabilty big deal in software eng. Not much work on numerical
algorithms. Inverse problems and medical imaging.
<br>
(RB) Design for testability
<br>
(BG) Has MS in CS , code inspection at RMC s/w for nuclear inspection.
<br>
(WL) Testing of of IP software, so that one transparently avoids any cheating,
whether or not intended, seems to be an interesting issue.
<br>
(RB) VLSI, scalability testing. TOAST experience suggests problem we might
encounter when code grows. Do we need built in test methods in EIDORS as it
grows?
<br>


 (AA) This is a great multidisciplinary collaboration. We need good testing
now.
<br>
 Repositary for standard data and  Meshes, as well as standard algorithms.
<br>


<li> (RB) Suggested giving EIDORS3D a higher profile on eit.org.uk to encourage
contributions. (WL) Suggested that we consolodate changes with the main
groups actively developing EIDORS3D first.
<br>

<li> AOB: The meeting thanked the AG coordinators, the video conferencing went
well apart from a loss of audio.
<br>

<li> It was agreed to schedule a meeting in about two months with London and
Dartmouth both joining us over AG as well.
 Action: HD, RB, AA, WL to check availability of their AG nodes.
<br>

    4 July 2004: 
</b><br>
A. Adler
<p>

EIDORS3D code now works with <a href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a>
as well as Matlab. Note that this is only for the numerical code;
graphics are not supported. Also, since octave does not support
some of the Cholesky and CG solvers, the solutions may be numerically
less stable.

<br><li><b>
    24 June 2004: Idea
</b><br>
A. Adler
<p>

EIDORS3D needs a logo. Should we have a blurry blob?
On the other hand, it also has to look 3D? And, it also has to look OK
when compressed really small.

<br><li><b>
    23 June 2004: Discussion
</b><br> W.R.B. Lionheart, A. Adler
<p>
In order to further EIDORS development, we developed the
following desirata for EIDORS software.
<ul>
    <li> <b>
        API design
    </b><br>
    EIDORS needs a clean, well-encapsulated and easy to understand
    API. We do not feel that an object oriented API is particularly
    useful because:
    1) the Matlab OO design is somewhat of a "hack"
    2) such an OO interface would make portability to other 
       languages less easy

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Language portability
    </b><br>
    EIDORS is primarily aimed at MATLAB. We would like to EIDORS
    to support Octave and Scilab, as far as possible. Currently,
    Octave and Scilab have the features needed by EIDORS (sparse
    matrices, 3D matrix support, etc.)
    <p>
    In the core, it should be possible to have portability. However,
    Matlab graphics features are not supported in these languages.
    Our idea is therefore to separate the graphics functions
    from the core code. Graphics code would therefore be permitted
    to be language specific.
    <p>
    Another desirable feature would be to support approaches
    to enhance execution speed: ie. C functions, multiprocessor
    support, etc. This is dealt with under <i>plug-in algorithms</i>

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Platform portability
    </b><br>
    EIDORS is intended to work on all platforms with support 
    Matlab/Scilab/Octave. This means Unix/Windows/Mac OSX.
    In order to do this, we have the following rules:
    <br>&minus; No spaces in file names
    <br>&minus; The path separator is '/'
    <br>&minus; File names are lower case letters and 
              numbers with optional underscores

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Plugin algorithms
    </b><br>
    Many users will want to use EIDORS infrastructure to test their
    own ideas. EIDORS should support <i>plugging in</i> such new
    algorithms or techniques. 
    <p>
    It is not obvious to us at this point exactly what features
    need to be added. Thus is is likely that some refactoring
    of the code will be required as we learn more about users needs.
    Please contact the authors with suggestions.

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Reference algorithms
    </b><br>
    One of the main goals of EIDORS is to allow people to compare
    their <i>new fangled algorithms</i> to those implemented by others.
    Unfortunately, the typical approach in this field has been to 
    compare the <i>new fangled</i> to badly implement versions 
    of others.
    Ideally, EIDORS will make it easy to do the comparison 
    correctly, <i>if desired</i>.
    <p>
    EIDORS should therefore offer:
    1) use of the <i>latest  and greatest</i>
        algorithms,
        and
    2) use of specific algorithms corresponding to
        specific papers

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Simple and transparent code-base
    </b><br>
    EIDORS code is primarily aimed at numerical researchers.
    This means EIDORS should be:
    <br>&minus; simple. Code should be sufficiently small for 
        an interested person to learn quite quickly
    <br>&minus; command line based. Code should expose it's capabilities
        and internal structure for inclusion into other algorithms.
        Graphic interface contributions will be accepted, but will
        be placed outside of the core.
    <br>&minus; modifiable. Many users will want to modify EIDORS
        to try their own ideas. This should be reasonably easy
        to do.
    <br>&minus; 

    <p>
    <li> <b>
    Encourage contributions
    </b><br>
    We want to find ways to encourage people to contibute:
    <ul>
       <li> Bug fixes
       <li> Sample data and meshes
       <li> Demo code and help files
       <li> new reconstruction algorithms
       <br>
       also inproved forward solver (with higher order elements,
        BEM-FEM, etc.)
       modifications to algorithms (e.g. anisotropic conductivity)
       <li> and meta-algorithms
       (e.g. erroneous electrode detection techniques)
       <li> visualization
       (e.g. code to export to graphics packages such as mayavi)
    </ul>

    <p>
    <li> <b>
    Define subdirectories cleanly
    </b><br>
    In order to separate algorithms and details.

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        File format
    </b><br>
    It would be nice to define a EIT data file format that
    would facilitate interchange of data. We would be interested
    in receiving any suggestions about what such a data format
    would include.
    <p>
    Things to include in the data file are
    <br>&minus; Time and date of each data measurement
    <br>&minus; Electrode locations / shape &amp; size / contact impedance
    <br>&minus; Current &amp; measurement patterns
    <br>&minus; The data itself
    <br>&minus; Sampling intervals
    <br>&minus; Description
    <p>
    It would be convenient to put data into a structure.

        Licence
    </b><br>
    The licence for EIDORS is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"
        >GPL</a>. Therefore, there are no problems with the following
    uses of EIDORS:
    <ul>
        <li> Selling EIT equipment with EIDORS on board, as 
             long as the source code is available.
        <li> Using EIDORS with proprietary software like Matlab
    </ul>
    The following uses of EIDORS are barred by the GPL
    <ul>
        <li> Compiling EIDORS or a derived work and selling
             a system wihout access to both EIDORS and the
             software it is linked to.
        <li> Rewriting EIDORS in a different language and
             distributing it not under the GPL (eg. without source code)
    </ul>
    We are currently thinking about the scenario in which an EIT
    vendor provides EIDORS (including source) along with a proprietary
    add-on, such as a GUI. Email us if you have opinions on this
    issue.
