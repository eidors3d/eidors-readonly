<h2>News</h2>
This page is a list of updates, discussions, and 
ideas for enhancements to the
EIDORS-3D package. Not all ideas will be implmeneted,
of course, but at least they're written down.

</b><br>

<p>

EIDORS3D needs a logo. Should we have a blurry blob?
On the other hand, it also has to look 3D? And, it also has to look OK
when compressed really small.

    23 June 2004: Discussion
</b><br> W.R.B. Lionheart, A. Adler
<p>
In order to further EIDORS development, we developed the
following desirata for EIDORS software.
<ul>
    <li> <b>
        API design
    </b><br>
    EIDORS needs a clean, well-encapsulated and easy to understand
    API. We do not feel that an object oriented API is particularly
    useful because:
    1) the Matlab OO design is somewhat of a "hack"
    2) such an OO interface would make portability to other 
       languages less easy

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Language portability
    </b><br>
    EIDORS is primarily aimed at MATLAB. We would like to EIDORS
    to support Octave and Scilab, as far as possible. Currently,
    Octave and Scilab have the features needed by EIDORS (sparse
    matrices, 3D matrix support, etc.)
    <p>
    In the core, it should be possible to have portability. However,
    Matlab graphics features are not supported in these languages.
    Our idea is therefore to separate the graphics functions
    from the core code. Graphics code would therefore be permitted
    to be language specific.
    <p>
    Another desirable feature would be to support approaches
    to enhance execution speed: ie. C functions, multiprocessor
    support, etc. This is dealt with under <i>plug-in algorithms</i>

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Platform portability
    </b><br>
    EIDORS is intended to work on all platforms with support 
    Matlab/Scilab/Octave. This means Unix/Windows/Mac OSX.
    In order to do this, we have the following rules:
    <br>&minus; No spaces in file names
    <br>&minus; The path separator is '/'
    <br>&minus; File names are lower case letters and 
              numbers with optional underscores

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Plugin algorithms
    </b><br>
    Many users will want to use EIDORS infrastructure to test their
    own ideas. EIDORS should support <i>plugging in</i> such new
    algorithms or techniques. 
    <p>
    It is not obvious to us at this point exactly what features
    need to be added. Thus is is likely that some refactoring
    of the code will be required as we learn more about users needs.
    Please contact the authors with suggestions.

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Reference algorithms
    </b><br>
    One of the main goals of EIDORS is to allow people to compare
    their <i>new fangled algorithms</i> to those implemented by others.
    Unfortunately, the typical approach in this field has been to 
    compare the <i>new fangled</i> to badly implement versions 
    of others.
    Ideally, EIDORS will make it easy to do the comparison 
    correctly, <i>if desired</i>.
    <p>
    EIDORS should therefore offer:
    1) use of the <i>latest  and greatest</i>
        algorithms,
        and
    2) use of specific algorithms corresponding to
        specific papers

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Simple and transparent code-base
    </b><br>
    EIDORS code is primarily aimed at numerical researchers.
    This means EIDORS should be:
    <br>&minus; simple. Code should be sufficiently small for 
        an interested person to learn quite quickly
    <br>&minus; command line based. Code should expose it's capabilities
        and internal structure for inclusion into other algorithms.
        Graphic interface contributions will be accepted, but will
        be placed outside of the core.
    <br>&minus; modifiable. Many users will want to modify EIDORS
        to try their own ideas. This should be reasonably easy
        to do.
    <br>&minus; 

    <p>
    <li> <b>
    Encourage contributions
    </b><br>
    We want to find ways to encourage people to contibute:
    <ul>
       <li> Bug fixes
       <li> Sample data and meshes
       <li> Demo code and help files
       <li> new reconstruction algorithms
       <br>
       also inproved forward solver (with higher order elements,
        BEM-FEM, etc.)
       modifications to algorithms (e.g. anisotropic conductivity)
       <li> and meta-algorithms
       (e.g. erroneous electrode detection techniques)
       <li> visualization
       (e.g. code to export to graphics packages such as mayavi)
    </ul>

    <p>
    <li> <b>
    Define subdirectories cleanly
    </b><br>
    In order to separate algorithms and details.

    <p>
    <li> <b>
        File format
    </b><br>
    It would be nice to define a EIT data file format that
    would facilitate interchange of data. We would be interested
    in receiving any suggestions about what such a data format
    would include.
    <p>
    Things to include in the data file are
    <br>&minus; Time and date of each data measurement
    <br>&minus; Electrode locations / shape &amp; size / contact impedance
    <br>&minus; Current &amp; measurement patterns
    <br>&minus; The data itself
    <br>&minus; Sampling intervals
    <br>&minus; Description
    <p>
    It would be convenient to put data into a structure.




    <p>
    <li> <b>
        Licence
    </b><br>
    The licence for EIDORS is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"
        >GPL</a>. Therefore, there are no problems with the following
    uses of EIDORS:
    <ul>
        <li> Selling EIT equipment with EIDORS on board, as 
             long as the source code is available.
        <li> Using EIDORS with proprietary software like Matlab
    </ul>
    The following uses of EIDORS are barred by the GPL
    <ul>
        <li> Compiling EIDORS or a derived work and selling
             a system wihout access to both EIDORS and the
             software it is linked to.
        <li> Rewriting EIDORS in a different language and
             distributing it not under the GPL (eg. without source code)
    </ul>
    We are currently thinking about the scenario in which an EIT
    vendor provides EIDORS (including source) along with a proprietary
    add-on, such as a GUI. Email us if you have opinions on this
    issue.
