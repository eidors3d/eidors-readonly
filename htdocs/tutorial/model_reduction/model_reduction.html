<h3>
Build Models
</h3>


<p>
First we build a circular 2D Netgen model. There are two stimulus electrodes
(#1 and #2) and two measurement electrodes (#3 and #4) with locations set by
selecting angle in degrees.
In addition, we have added two interior electrodes (#5 and #6) with a particular separation (Figure 1).

</p>

<h3>
Reduce Model
</h3>

<p>
The model is then reduced to a fully-connected "mesh" network of resistors (Figure 2).
Some mesh networks may be reduced to a "star" configuration, reducing the
resistors and wiring criss-cross in a physical implementation, but we do not address
that conversion here.

[% PROCESS "model_reduction02.m" %]
</pre>
The fully-connected mesh network is illustrated with the following code, by
stripping away the FEM lines and drawing connected lines between number
electrodes.

<h3>
Find Appropriate Resistors
</h3>

<p>
The best standard resistors for our particular mesh can then be found by minimizing the fitting error
<pre>
[% PROCESS "model_reduction03.m" %]
</pre>
which, for the first model (40% diametre interior electrode separation) gives a
resistor configuration in the form of an upper triangular matrix
<pre>
[% PROCESS "model_reduction03.txt" %]
</pre>
where the resistor values are given by the off-diagonal values between each row
(electrode n) and column (electrode m) with resistor selection error minimized (Figure 3).

</center>
</p>

<p>
Commonly available resistors are defined by EIA standards
<pre>
[% PROCESS "model_reduction03_stdres.m" %]
</pre>
which is used to calculate the misfit between ideal resistor values and available resistor values
<pre>
[% PROCESS "model_reduction03_calc_err.m" %]
