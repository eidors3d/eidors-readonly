<h2>Reconstruction of real and complex components</H2>

Many EIT systems allow measurement of the in-phase
and quadrature signals from the voltage data. From these
data a complex measurement phasor is calculated. Image
can be directly reconstructed, although there are 
some challenges in showing the images.
