<h2>
Image reconstruction of moving objects
</H2>

These results are taken from the paper:
<ul>
Andy Adler, Tao Dai, William R.B. Lionheart
<i>Temporal Image Reconstruction in Electrical Impedance Tomography</i>
Physiol. Meas., 2007.
</ul>

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) calculates images of the body
from body impedance measurements. While the spatial resolution of
these images is relatively low, the temporal resolution of EIT
data can be high. Most EIT reconstruction algorithms solve each
data frame independently, although Kalman filter algorithms track
the image changes across frames. This paper proposes a new approach
which directly accounts for correlations between images in successive
data frames.  Image reconstruction is posed in terms of an augmented
image <b>x</b> and measurement vector <b>y</b>,
 which concatenate the values from
the <i>d</i> previous and future frames. Image reconstruction is then based
on an augmented regularization matrix <b>R</b>, which accounts for a model
of both the spatial and temporal correlations between image elements.
Results are compared for reconstruction algorithms based on independent
frames, Kalman filters, and the proposed approach. For low values of the
regularization hyperparameter, the proposed approach performs similarly
to independent frames, but for higher hyperparameter values, it uses
adjacent frame data to reduce reconstructed image noise.

<h3>
Sample Data
</H3>

Simulated data are calculated using the function
<tt>simulate_2d_movement</tt>, which models a
small (0.05&times;radius) object moving in a 
circle in a 2D circular tank.  These data are 
<a href="../../data_contrib/aa_simulate_2d_movement/aa_simulate_2d_movement.shtml"> available here</a>.
<p>
Since the temporal solver works best for noisy data,
we simulate a fairly low SNR (high NSR). To understand
why the temporal solver works best at for noisy data,
consider that if data are clean, then there is no reason
to look at data from the past/future, since the current
measurement tells us everything we need to know.

<h3>
Reconstruction Algorithms
</H3>

<p>


Over time steps, <i>k</i>, a sequence of
difference vectors, <b>y</b><sub>k</sub> =
<b>J</b><b>x</b><sub>k</sub>, are measured (assuming
the body and electrode geometry, and thus <b>J</b>, stay
fixed). If the conductivity of the body under investigation
doesn’t change too rapidly, then it is reasonable to expect
that a certain number of measurements, <i>d</i>, into
the past and future provide useful information about the
current image. Labelling the current instant as <i>t</i>,
we therefore seek to estimate <b>x</b><sub>t</sub> from
data [<b>y</b><sub>t-d</sub>; ... ; <b>y</b><sub>t-1</sub>;
<b>y</b><sub>t</sub>; <b>y</b><sub>t+1</sub>; ... ;
<b>y</b><sub>t+d</sub>].
<p>

In the subsequent sections we consider three traditional approaches and the
proposed temporal inverse; each estimates <b>x</b><sub>t</sub> at frame <i>t</i> from a sequence of data starting
at frame 0, using the indicated data:
<ol>
 <li> Gauss-Newton (GN) inverse, using <b>y</b><sub>t</sub>
 only;

 <li> GN with weighted data, using a weighted average of
 <b>y</b><sub>t-d</sub> ... <b>y</b><sub>t+d</sub>;

 <li> Kalman filter inverse, using all previous and current
 data, <b>y</b><sub>0</sub> ... <b>y</b><sub>t</sub>; 

 <li> Temporal inverse, using <b>y</b><sub>t-d</sub>
 ... <b>y</b><sub>t+d</sub> based on a temporal prior
 model.

</ol>

The following code defines the reconstruction algorithms:

Image Reconstruction

We reconstruct the image at 9&nbsp;O'clock using
each algorithm, using the code:
