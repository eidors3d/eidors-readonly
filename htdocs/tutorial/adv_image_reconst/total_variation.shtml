<h2> 
Iterative Gauss Newton reconstruction in 3D
</h2>

This tutorial shows the generation of images from the
paper:
<ul>
<i>Total Variation Regularization in Electrical Impedance Tomography</i>
Andrea Borsic, Brad M. Graham, Andy Adler, William R. B. Lionheart 
</ul>

The first step is to simulate an image which
has a blocky shape (here we choose a pie slice).

<pre>
<!--#include virtual="total_variation01.m" -->
</pre>

<h3> GN reconstruction </h3>

<!--#include virtual="total_variation02.m" -->
</pre>

Simulation image (left) and GN reconstructed image (right)
Gauss-Newton (2-norm) reconstructions are not
very successful for this shape.
<i>Note:</i> The 'sliver' of background shown on the meshes
at right is a rendering bug in matlab 6.5. It does not
show up in the matlab window.

<h3> TV reconstruction </h3>
One technique to permit image regularization without imposing smooth-
ing is the Total Variation (TV) formulation of regularization. The Total
Variation functional is assuming an important role in the regularization
of inverse problems belonging to many disciplines, thanks to its ability to
preserve discontinuities in the reconstructed profiles. Application of
non-smooth reconstruction techniques is important for medical and process
imaging applications of EIT, as they involve discontinuous profiles.
Qualitative and quantitative benefits can be expected in these fields.
<p>
We outline the properties of the TV functional in the next section, to
motivate its use as a regularization penalty term and to understand the nu-
merical difficulties associated with it. The use of the TV functional leads
in fact to the formulation of the inverse problem as a minimization of a
non-differentiable function. Application of traditional minimization
techniques (Steepest Descent Method, Newton Method) has proven to be
inefficient [Dobson, Santosa, 1994][Borsic, 2002].
Recent developments in non-smooth optimization (Primal
Dual-Interior Point Methods) have brought the means of dealing with the
minimization problem efficiently. The performance of this algorithm with
respect to traditional smooth algorithms is the subject of this paper.

<h3> TV reconstruction vs iteration </h3>

In order to understand how TV reconstructions improve with
the iteration number, we calculate:

number.
