<h2> 
Dual Models using a rectangular mesh of a volume slice
</h2>

If we wish to reconstruct a slice of a volume onto
a rectangular mesh, that can be done using the
following dual model scheme.
A common use of dual models is to allow the forward
model to represent the entire space, while the
reconstruction model represents a slice through
the volume at the place of interest. 

<h3> 
Rectangular mesh represented as a triangular FEM
</h3>
<p>
The rectangular mesh is represented as a triangular
FEM where each square pixel includes two triangular
elements. The model is parametrized such that 
both elements in each pixel have the same parameter

[% PROCESS "square_mesh01.m" %]

32&times;32 rectangular mesh representing a square
pixels in the space. The parameterization is chosen
so the parameter is the same for both elements
in each pixel.

<h3> 
Dual mesh correspondance
</h3>
<p>
First, we select the vertical extent of the
coarse mesh (<i>z</i><sub>depth</sub>=0.1). 
This can be shown as follows:
<pre>
[% PROCESS "square_mesh02.m" %]
</pre>

Next, we show the coarse and fine models
and their relationship. 

<pre>
[% PROCESS "square_mesh03.m" %]
</pre>

<i>Right</i> correspondence between coarse and fine model.

<h3> 
Simulation Data
</h3>

We simulate a ball moving in
a helical path on a fine netgen model.
<pre>
[% PROCESS "square_mesh04.m" %]
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> this stimulation requires at least 4GB memory
and many minutes of CPU time to run. The calculated data
are available 
<a href="./square_mesh04_output.mat">here</a>

16&times;1 electrode tank on which data
are sumulated. The
positions of the simulated conductive target moving in
a helical path are shown in purple, and the plane of
the reconstructed images are shown in blue.

<h3> 
Reconstruct Images
</h3>

First, we reconstruct images on the rectangular
mesh, using the coarse to fine mapping.
<pre>
[% PROCESS "square_mesh05.m" %]
</pre>
Next, we reconstruct images on a classic 2D
circular FEM, and compare the images.
<pre>
[% PROCESS "square_mesh06.m" %]
</pre>
