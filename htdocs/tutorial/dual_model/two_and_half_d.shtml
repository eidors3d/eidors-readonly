<h2> 
Two and a half dim (2&frac12;D) image reconstruction
</h2>

The term "2&frac12;D" originates from geophysics.
Measurements are made around a medium (or in a borehole)
in 3D. However, in order to simplify image reconstruction,
the medium properties are assumed to be constant in
the <i>z</i> direction. 
<p>
Thus, the <i>z</i> direction is part of the forward
model, but not the inverse. It is thus "half" a 
dimension.

<p>
This tutorial shows how to do this as a application
of coarse/fine mapping, where the a fine (high density)
forward model is used with a coarse (low density) 
inverse model.

<h3> Image reconstruction </h3>

First, show the simulated target and
the reconstruction on the fine (<i>inverse crime</i>)
mesh.
<pre>
[% PROCESS "two_and_half_d02.m" %]
</pre>

Next, create geometries for the fine and
coarse mesh. 
Images are reconstructed by calling the
<tt>coase_fine_solver</tt> function rather
than the original. (<i>Note</i> this function
still needs some work, it doesn't account for
all cases)

<pre>
[% PROCESS "two_and_half_d03.m" %]
</pre>

Note the reconstructed image on the coarse
mesh is extruded into 2D, as the assumptions
require.
