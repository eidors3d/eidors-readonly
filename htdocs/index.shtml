<H2>Project Goal</H2>
The idea of this project is to promote a collaboration between groups
working on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and Diffusion based
Optical Tomography, in medical and industrial settings.  The aim is
to produce a suite of programs which perform mesh generation
reconstruction and display for both techniques.  We hope that we can
produce robust, reliable and fairly portable software which draws on
our collective expertise and implements some of the latest innovations.

<H2>Getting Started</H2>

To try the EIDORS software, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li> Download the software (release or developer version):
    <ul>
    <li> <i>Release Version:</i>
         <a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/eidors3d/eidors-v3.1.zip"
             >EIDORS 3.1</a>
    <li> <i>Developer Version:</i>
         Follow instructions for 
         <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=100454"
            >Anonymous CVS Access</a>
    </ul>

<li> Unzip the software in a directory <tt>DIR</tt>

<li> Start Matlab (or Octave), and cd to <tt>DIR</tt>

<li> type:<br> <tt>
     startup<br>
     cd examples<br>
     </tt>

<li> Execute one of the sample programs in the <tt>examples</tt>
     directory (such as <tt>demo_real.m</tt>)
</ol>
