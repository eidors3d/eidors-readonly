abstract = {ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Lung protective ventilation requires low tidal volume and suitable positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). To date, few methods have been accepted for clinical use to set the appropriate PEEP. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of PEEP titration guided by ventilation homogeneity using the global inhomogeneity (GI) index based on electrical impedance tomography (EIT) images. METHODS: In a retrospective study, 10 anesthetized patients with healthy lungs mechanically ventilated under volume-controlled mode were investigated. Ventilation distribution was monitored by EIT. A standardized incremental PEEP trial (PEEP from 0 to 28 mbar, 2 mbar per step) was conducted. During the PEEP trial, "optimal" PEEP level for each patient was determined when the air was most homogeneously distributed in the lung, indicated by the lowest GI index value. Two published methods for setting PEEP were included for comparison based on the maximum global dynamic compliance and the intra-tidal compliance-volume curve. RESULTS: No significant differences in the results were observed between the GI index method (12.2 +/- 4.6 mbar) and the dynamic compliance method (11.4 +/- 2.3 mbar, P > 0.6), or between the GI index and the compliance-volume curve method (12.2 +/- 4.9 mbar, P > 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, it is feasible and reasonable to use the GI index to select the PEEP level with respect to ventilation homogeneity. The GI index may provide new insights into the relationship between lung mechanics and tidal volume distribution and may be used to guide ventilator settings.},

@article{Gattinoni2010,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last 2 years, several reports have dealt with recruitment/positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) selection. Most of them confirm previous results and few add new information.

RECENT FINDINGS: It has been definitely confirmed that opening pressures are different throughout the acute respiratory distress syndrome lung parenchyma, ranging from 5-10 up to 30-40 cmH2O. The highest opening pressures are required to open the most dependent lung regions. It has been found that in 2 s, most of the recruitable lung regions may be open when a proper pressure is applied. The best way to assess recruitment is computed tomography scanning, whereas lung mechanics are a reasonable bedside surrogate. Impedance tomography has been increasingly tested, whereas gas exchange is the less reliable indicator of recruitment. A large outcome study showed that higher PEEP might provide survival benefit in a subgroup of more severe patients as compared with lower PEEP. To set PEEP in each individual patient, the use of the expiratory limb of the pressure-volume curve has been suggested. Setting PEEP according to transpulmonary pressure has a robust physiological background, although it requires confirmatory study.

SUMMARY: Indiscriminate application of recruitment maneuver in unselected acute respiratory distress syndrome population does not provide benefits. However, in the most severe patients, recruitment maneuver has to be considered and higher PEEP applied. To individualize PEEP, the expiratory phase has to be considered, and the esophageal pressure measurement to compute the transpulmonary pressure should be progressively introduced in clinical practice.},

@article{Deibele2008,
abstract = {In spontaneously breathing or ventilated subjects, it is difficult to image cardiac-related conductivity changes using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) due to the high amplitude of the ventilation component. Previous attempts to separate these components included either electrocardiogram-gated averaging, frequency domain filtering or holding the breath while performing the measurements. However, such methods are either not able to produce continuous real-time images or to fully separate cardiac and pulmonary changes. The aim of this work was to develop a new dynamic filtering method for the online separation of pulmonary and cardiac changes avoiding the drawbacks of the previous attempts. The approach is based on estimating template functions for the pulmonary and cardiac components by means of principal component analysis and frequency domain filtering. Then, these templates are fitted into the input signals. The new method enables an observer to examine the variation of the cardiac signal beat-by-beat after a one-time setup period of 20 s. Preliminary in vivo results of two healthy subjects are presented. The results are superior to frequency domain filtering and in good agreement with signals averaged over several cardiac cycles. The method does not depend on ECG or other a priori knowledge. The apparent validity of the method's ability to separate cardiac and pulmonary changes in EIT images was shown and has to be confirmed in future studies. The algorithm opens up new possibilities for future clinical trials on continuous monitoring by means of EIT and for the examination of the relation between the cardiac component and lung perfusion.},

@article{Yang2013,
abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a fast and cost-effective technique to provide a tomographic conductivity image of a subject from boundary current-voltage data. This paper proposes a time and memory efficient method for solving a large scale 3D EIT inverse problem using a parallel conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm. The 3D EIT system with a large number of measurement data can produce a large size of Jacobian matrix; this could cause difficulties in computer storage and the inversion process. One of challenges in 3D EIT is to decrease the reconstruction time and memory usage, at the same time retaining the image quality. Firstly, a sparse matrix reduction technique is proposed using thresholding to set very small values of the Jacobian matrix to zero. By adjusting the Jacobian matrix into a sparse format, the element with zeros would be eliminated, which results in a saving of memory requirement. Secondly, a block-wise CG method for parallel reconstruction has been developed. The proposed method has been tested using simulated data as well as experimental test samples. Sparse Jacobian with a block-wise CG enables the large scale EIT problem to be solved efficiently. Image quality measures are presented to quantify the effect of sparse matrix reduction in reconstruction results.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance-electrical impedance tomography (MR-EIT) was first proposed in 1992. Since then various reconstruction algorithms have been suggested and applied. These algorithms use peripheral voltage measurements and internal current density measurements in different combinations. In this study the problem of MR-EIT is treated as a hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations, and three numerical methods are proposed for its solution. This approach is not utilized in any of the algorithms proposed earlier. The numerical solution methods are integration along equipotential surfaces (method of characteristics), integration on a Cartesian grid, and inversion of a system matrix derived by a finite difference formulation. It is shown that if some uniqueness conditions are satisfied, then using at least two injected current patterns, resistivity can be reconstructed apart from a multiplicative constant. This constant can then be identified using a single voltage measurement. The methods proposed are direct, non-iterative, and valid and feasible for 3D reconstructions. They can also be used to easily obtain slice and field-of-view images from a 3D object. 2D simulations are made to illustrate the performance of the algorithms.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review article summarizes the recent advances in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) related to cardiopulmonary imaging and monitoring on the background of the 30-year development of this technology.

RECENT FINDINGS: EIT is expected to become a bedside tool for monitoring and guiding ventilator therapy. In this context, several studies applied EIT to determine spatial ventilation distribution during different ventilation modes and settings. EIT was increasingly combined with other signals, such as airway pressure, enabling the assessment of regional respiratory system mechanics. EIT was for the first time used prospectively to define ventilator settings in an experimental and a clinical study. Increased neonatal and paediatric use of EIT was noted. Only few studies focused on cardiac function and lung perfusion. Advanced radiological imaging techniques were applied to assess EIT performance in detecting regional lung ventilation. New approaches to improve the quality of thoracic EIT images were proposed.

SUMMARY: EIT is not routinely used in a clinical setting, but the interest in EIT is evident. The major task for EIT research is to provide the clinicians with guidelines how to conduct, analyse and interpret EIT examinations and combine them with other medical techniques so as to meaningfully impact the clinical decision-making.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an attractive method for clinically monitoring patients during mechanical ventilation, because it can provide a non-invasive continuous image of pulmonary impedance which indicates the distribution of ventilation. However, most clinical and physiological research in lung EIT is done using older and proprietary algorithms; this is an obstacle to interpretation of EIT images because the reconstructed images are not well characterized. To address this issue, we develop a consensus linear reconstruction algorithm for lung EIT, called GREIT (Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT). This paper describes the unified approach to linear image reconstruction developed for GREIT. The framework for the linear reconstruction algorithm consists of (1) detailed finite element models of a representative adult and neonatal thorax, (2) consensus on the performance figures of merit for EIT image reconstruction and (3) a systematic approach to optimize a linear reconstruction matrix to desired performance measures. Consensus figures of merit, in order of importance, are (a) uniform amplitude response, (b) small and uniform position error, (c) small ringing artefacts, (d) uniform resolution, (e) limited shape deformation and (f) high resolution. Such figures of merit must be attained while maintaining small noise amplification and small sensitivity to electrode and boundary movement. This approach represents the consensus of a large and representative group of experts in EIT algorithm design and clinical applications for pulmonary monitoring. All software and data to implement and test the algorithm have been made available under an open source license which allows free research and commercial use.},

abstract = {The main function of the respiratory system is gas exchange. Since many disease or injury conditions can cause biomechanical or material property changes that can alter lung function, there is a great interest in measuring regional lung ventilation and regional specific volume change. We describe a registration-based technique for estimating local lung expansion from multiple respiratory-gated CT images of the thorax. The degree of regional lung expansion is measured using the Jacobian (a function of local partial derivatives) of the registration displacement field, which we show is directly related to specific volume change. We compare the ventral-dorsal patterns of lung expansion estimated across five pressure changes to a xenon CT based measure of specific ventilation in five anesthetized sheep studied in the supine orientation. Using 3D image registration to match images acquired at 10 cm H(2)O and 15 cm H(2)O airway pressures gave the best match between the average Jacobian and the xenon CT specific ventilation (linear regression, average r(2)=0.73).},

Problems with existing devices based on electrochemistry have encouraged alternative approaches to glucose sensing in recent years, and those based on fluorescence intensity and lifetime have special advantages, including sensitivity and the potential for non-invasive measurement when near-infrared light is used. Several receptors have been employed to detect glucose in fluorescence sensors, and these include the lectin concanavalin A (Con A), enzymes such as glucose oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase and hexokinase/glucokinase, bacterial glucose-binding protein, and boronic acid derivatives (which bind the diols of sugars). Techniques include measuring changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a fluorescent donor and an acceptor either within a protein which undergoes glucose-induced changes in conformation or because of competitive displacement; measurement of glucose-induced changes in intrinsic fluorescence of enzymes (e.g. due to tryptophan residues in hexokinase) or extrinsic fluorophores (e.g. using environmentally sensitive fluorophores to signal protein conformation). Non-invasive glucose monitoring can be accomplished by measurement of cell autofluorescence due to NAD(P)H, and fluorescent markers of mitochondrial metabolism can signal changes in extracellular glucose concentration. Here we review the principles of operation, context and current status of the various approaches to fluorescence-based glucose sensing.},

abstract = {The electric conductivity can potentially be used as an additional diagnostic parameter, e.g., in tumor diagnosis. Moreover, the electric conductivity, in connection with the electric field, can be used to estimate the local SAR distribution during MR measurements. In this study, a new approach, called electric properties tomography (EPT) is presented. It derives the patient's electric conductivity, along with the corresponding electric fields, from the spatial sensitivity distributions of the applied RF coils, which are measured via MRI. Corresponding numerical simulations and initial experiments on a standard clinical MRI system underline the principal feasibility of EPT to determine the electric conductivity and the local SAR. In contrast to previous methods to measure the patient's electric properties, EPT does not apply externally mounted electrodes, currents, or RF probes, thus enhancing the practicality of the approach. Furthermore, in contrast to previous methods, EPT circumvents the solution of an inverse problem, which might lead to significantly higher spatial image resolution.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: The validation of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for measuring regional ventilation distribution by comparing it with single photon emission CT (SPECT) scanning. DESIGN: Randomized, prospective animal study. SETTINGS: Animal laboratories and nuclear medicine laboratories at a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve anesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs. INTERVENTIONS: Lung injury was induced by central venous injection of oleic acid. Then pigs were randomized to pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation, airway pressure-release ventilation, or spontaneous breathing. Measurements and results: Ventilation distribution was assessed by EIT using cross-sectional electrotomographic measurements of the thorax, and simultaneously by single SPECT scanning with the inhalation of (99m)Tc-labeled carbon particles. For both methods, the evaluation of ventilation distribution was performed in the same transverse slice that was approximately 4 cm in thickness. The transverse slice then was divided into 20 coronal segments (going from the sternum to the spine). We compared the percentage of ventilation in each segment, normalized to the entire ventilation in the observed slice. Our data showed an excellent linear correlation between the ventilation distribution measured by SPECT scanning and EIT according to the following equation: y = 0.82x + 0.7 (R(2) = 0.92; range, 0.86 to 0.97). CONCLUSION: Based on these data, EIT seems to allow, at least in comparable states of lung injury, real-time monitoring of regional ventilation distribution at the bedside.},

@article{Kaipio2000,
abstract = {This paper discusses the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) problem: electric currents are injected into a body with unknown electromagnetic properties through a set of contact electrodes. The corresponding voltages that are needed to maintain these currents are measured. The objective is to estimate the unknown resistivity, or more generally the impedivity distribution of the body based on this information. The most commonly used method to tackle this problem in practice is to use gradient-based local linearizations. We give a proof for the differentiability of the electrode boundary data with respect to the resistivity distribution and the contact impedances. Due to the ill-posedness of the problem, regularization has to be employed. In this paper, we consider the EIT problem in the framework of Bayesian statistics, where the inverse problem is recast into a form of statistical inference. The problem is to estimate the posterior distribution of the unknown parameters conditioned on measurement data. From the posterior density, various estimates for the resistivity distribution can be calculated as well as a posteriori uncertainties. The search of the maximum a posteriori estimate is typically an optimization problem, while the conditional expectation is computed by integrating the variable with respect to the posterior probability distribution. In practice, especially when the dimension of the parameter space is large, this integration must be done by Monte Carlo methods such as the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. These methods can also be used for calculation of a posteriori uncertainties for the estimators. In this paper, we concentrate on MCMC integration methods. In particular, we demonstrate by numerical examples the statistical approach when the prior densities are non-differentiable, such as the prior penalizing the total variation or the L 1 norm of the resistivity.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has the potential to produce images during epileptic seizures. This might improve the accuracy of the localization of epileptic foci in patients undergoing presurgical assessment for curative neurosurgery. It has already been shown that impedance increases by up to 22\% during induced epileptic seizures in animal models, using cortical or implanted electrodes in controlled experiments. The purpose of this study was to determine if reproducible raw impedance changes and EIT images could be collected during epileptic seizures in patients who were undergoing observation with video-electroencephalography (EEG) telemetry as part of evaluation prior to neurosurgery to resect the region of brain causing the epilepsy. A secondary purpose was to develop an objective method for processing and evaluating data, as seizures arose at unpredictable times from a noisy baseline. Four-terminal impedance measurements from 258 combinations were collected continuously using 32 EEG scalp electrodes in 22 seizure episodes from 7 patients during their presurgical assessment together with the standard EEG recordings. A reliable method for defining the pre-seizure baseline and recording impedance data and EIT images was developed, in which EIT and EEG could be acquired simultaneously after filtering of EIT artefact from the EEG signal. Fluctuations of several per cent over minutes were observed in the baseline between seizures. During seizures, boundary voltage changes diverged with a standard deviation of 1-54\% from the baseline. No reproducible changes with the expected time course of some tens of seconds and magnitude of about 0.1\% could be reliably measured. This demonstrates that it is feasible to acquire EIT images in parallel with standard EEG during presurgical assessment but, unfortunately, expected EIT changes on the scalp of about 0.1\% are swamped by much larger movement and systematic artefact. Nevertheless, EIT has the unique potential to provide invaluable neuroimaging data for this purpose and may still become possible with improvements in electrode design and instrumentation.},

The first group consisted of 22 patients with clinical diagnosis of lung cancer with tumour localization in one lung. The second group consisted of seven healthy subjects. A patient after a one-sided pneumectomy and another with one-sided emphysema diagnosis were also examined. Static EIT images of a healthy human chest and a chest with various abnormalities are given and discussed. The evaluated system distinguishably visualizes various states of lungs and thorax including lung cancer. The average static conductivity of an affected lung in the first clinical group statistically differs from the average conductivity of a healthy lung. In spite of low spatial resolution, according to preliminary results, the method can be sensitive to cancer and other lung diseases in screening investigations.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography, EIT, is an imaging modality in which the internal conductivity distribution of an object is reconstructed based on voltage measurements on the boundary. This reconstruction problem is a nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem, which requires regularization to ensure a stable solution. Most popular regularization approaches enforce smoothness in the inverse solution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to build a subspace for regularization using a spectral and spatial multi-frequency analysis approach. The approach is based on the construction of a subspace for the expected conductivity distributions using principal component analysis. It is shown via simulations that the reconstructed images obtained with the proposed method are better than with the standard regularization approach. Using this approach, the percentage of misclassified finite elements was reduced up to twelve fold from the initial percentages after five iterations. The advantage of this technique is that prior information is extracted from the characteristic response of an object at different frequencies and spatially across the finite elements.},

abstract = {Bio-electric impedance signatures arise primarily from differences in cellular morphologies within an organ and can be used to differentiate benign and malignant pathologies, specifically in the breast. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging modality that determines the impedance distribution within tissue and has been used in prior work to map the electrical properties of breast at signal frequencies ranging from a few kHz to 1 MHz. It has been suggested that by extending the frequency range, additional information of clinical significance may be obtained. We have, therefore, developed a new EIT system for breast imaging which covers the frequency range from 10 kHz to 10 MHz. The instrument developed here is a distributed processor tomograph with 64 channels, capable of generating and measuring voltages and currents. Electrical benchmarking has shown the system to have a SNR greater than 94 dB up to 2 MHz, 90 dB up to 7 MHz, and 65 dB at 10 MHz. In addition, the system measures impedances to an accuracy of 99.7 \% and has channel-to-channel variations of less than 0.05 \%. Phantom imaging has demonstrated the ability to image across the entire frequency range in both single- and multiplane configurations. Further, 96 women have participated safely in breast exams with the system and the associated conductivity spectra obtained from 3-D image reconstructions range from 0.0237 S/m at 10 kHz to 0.2174 S/m at 10 MHz. These findings are consistent with impedance values reported in the literature.},

@article{Fagerberg2009,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can be used to measure impedance changes related to the thoracic content of air and blood. Few studies, however, have utilised EIT to make concurrent measurements of ventilation and perfusion. This experimental study was performed to investigate the feasibility of EIT to describe ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching after acute changes of pulmonary perfusion and aeration. METHODS: Six mechanically ventilated, anaesthetised pigs in the supine position were studied at baseline, after inflation of a balloon in the inferior caval vein (Binfl) to reduce cardiac output and after an increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 20 cmH2O (PEEP20) to increase pulmonary aeration. EIT measurements were performed at the mid-thoracic level to measure the amplitude of impedance changes related to ventilation (ZV) and perfusion (ZQ), both globally and in four defined regions of interest (ROI) extending from the ventral to dorsal distance. RESULTS: A largely parallel distribution of ZV and ZQ in all four ROIs during baseline conditions corresponded to a bell-shaped frequency distribution of ZV/ZQ ratios with only moderate scatter. Binfl and PEEP20 with unchanged tidal volumes significantly increased the mismatch of regional ZV and ZQ, the scatter of ZV/ZQ ratios and the heterogeneity of the ZV/ZQ frequency distribution. Significant positive and negative correlations were demonstrated between fractional alveolar dead space (r2 = 0.63 [regression coefficient]) and venous admixture (r2 = 0.48), respectively, and the global ZV/ZQ ratio. CONCLUSIONS: EIT may be used to monitor the distribution of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion making detailed studies of V/Q matching possible.},

abstract = {RF field B1 nonuniformity is the largest cause of error in the quantitative measurement of many clinically relevant parameters in MR images and spectra. Knowledge of the absolute flip angles at every region will improve the accuracy and precision of such parameters. This method uses the 180 degrees signal null to construct a flip angle map of the entire brain in less than 4 min, independent of T1, T2, and proton density. Three spoiled gradient echo volume acquisitions of the whole brain were made with three different flip angles. The optimum choice of flip angles was determined to be 145 degrees, 180 degrees, and 215 degrees. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the nominal (system calibrated) flip angle required for a signal null at every pixel and thence determine the absolute flip angle at that location. The experiment utilizes an existing MR sequence supplied by the scanner manufacturer. The technique is validated experimentally and a theoretical investigation into the optimum experimental parameters is presented.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a functional imaging modality capable of tracing continuously regional pulmonary gas volume changes. The aim of our study was to determine if EIT was able to assess spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ventilation during pulmonary function testing in 14 young (37 ± 10 yr, mean age ± SD) and 12 elderly (71 ± 9 yr) subjects without lung disease and in 33 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (71 ± 9 yr). EIT and spirometry examinations were performed during tidal breathing and a forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuver preceded by full inspiration to total lung capacity. Regional inspiratory vital capacity (IVC); FVC; forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)); FEV(1)/FVC; times required to expire 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 90\% of FVC (t(25), t(50), t(75), t(90)); and tidal volume (V(T)) were determined in 912 EIT image pixels in the chest cross section. Coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated from all pixel values of IVC, FVC, FEV(1), and V(T) to characterize the ventilation heterogeneity. The highest values were found in patients, and no differences existed between the healthy young and elderly subjects. Receiver-operating characteristics curves showed that CV of regional IVC, FVC, FEV(1), and V(T) discriminated the young and elderly subjects from the patients. Frequency distributions of pixel FEV(1)/FVC, t(25), t(50), t(75), and t(90) identified the highest ventilation heterogeneity in patients but distinguished also the healthy young from the elderly subjects. These results indicate that EIT may provide additional information during pulmonary function testing and identify pathologic and age-related spatial and temporal heterogeneity of regional lung function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional approaches to mechanical ventilation use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight and may cause stretch-induced lung injury in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: Patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The primary outcomes were death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance and the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [+/-SD], 12+/-11 vs. 10+/-11; P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2+/-0.8 and 11.8+/-0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P<0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25+/-6 and 33+/-8 cm of water (P<0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results in decreased mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use.},

abstract = {Measurement of regional lung volume changes during a quasi-static pressure-volume (PV) manoeuvre using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) could be used to assess regional respiratory system mechanics and to determine optimal ventilator settings in individual patients. Using this approach, we studied regional respiratory system mechanics in healthy and lung-injured animals, before and after surfactant administration during inflation and deflation PV manoeuvres. The comparison of the EIT-derived regional PV curves in ventral, middle and dorsal regions of the right and left lungs showed not only different amounts of hysteresis in these regions but also marked differences among different landmark pressures calculated on the inflation and deflation limbs of the curves. Regional pressures at maximum compliance as well as the lower and upper pressures of maximum compliance change differed between the inflation and deflation and increased from ventral to dorsal regions in all lung conditions. All these pressure values increased in the injured and decreased in the surfactant treated lungs. Examination of regional respiratory system mechanics using EIT enables the assessment of spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the ventilation distribution. Characteristic landmarks on the inflation and especially on the deflation limb of regional PV curves may become useful measures for guiding mechanical ventilation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review article summarizes the recent advances in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) related to cardiopulmonary imaging and monitoring on the background of the 30-year development of this technology.

RECENT FINDINGS: EIT is expected to become a bedside tool for monitoring and guiding ventilator therapy. In this context, several studies applied EIT to determine spatial ventilation distribution during different ventilation modes and settings. EIT was increasingly combined with other signals, such as airway pressure, enabling the assessment of regional respiratory system mechanics. EIT was for the first time used prospectively to define ventilator settings in an experimental and a clinical study. Increased neonatal and paediatric use of EIT was noted. Only few studies focused on cardiac function and lung perfusion. Advanced radiological imaging techniques were applied to assess EIT performance in detecting regional lung ventilation. New approaches to improve the quality of thoracic EIT images were proposed.

SUMMARY: EIT is not routinely used in a clinical setting, but the interest in EIT is evident. The major task for EIT research is to provide the clinicians with guidelines how to conduct, analyse and interpret EIT examinations and combine them with other medical techniques so as to meaningfully impact the clinical decision-making.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is to visualize the internal current density and conductivity of an electrically conductive object. Injecting current through surface electrodes, we measure one component of the induced internal magnetic flux density using an MRI scanner. In order to reconstruct the conductivity distribution inside the imaging object, most algorithms in MREIT have required multiple magnetic flux density data by injecting at least two independent currents. In this paper, we propose a direct method to reconstruct the internal isotropic conductivity with one component of magnetic flux density data by injecting one current into the imaging object through a single pair of surface electrodes. Firstly, the proposed method reconstructs a projected current density which is a uniquely determined current from the measured one-component magnetic flux density. Using a relation between voltage potential and current, based on Kirchhoff's voltage law, the proposed method is designed to use a combination of two loops around each pixel from which to derive an implicit matrix system for determination of the internal conductivity. Results from numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm stably determines the conductivity distribution in an imaging slice. We compare the reconstructed internal conductivity distribution using the proposed method with that using a conventional method with agarose gel phantom experiments.},

abstract = {The objective of magnetic detection electrical impedance tomography (MD-EIT) is to reconstruct in vivo images of conductivity from magnetic field measurements taken around the body. MD-EIT is performed by applying an alternating current, at one of a range of frequencies, to a conducting object through a pair of electrodes fixed to the surface of the object. Magnetic field measurements recorded by search coils at a number of positions around the object are used to determine the current distribution that is generating the magnetic field. From this distribution, a conductivity map of a cross-section of the object can be reconstructed. This paper describes the development of an MD-EIT data acquisition system and discusses the related image reconstruction issues. The ill-conditioned nature of the inverse problem is examined and a number of image reconstruction methods are compared. The technical feasibility of MD-EIT data collection and image reconstruction is demonstrated with example images of current density from both phantom and human data.},

Ordered subsets methods group projection data into an ordered sequence of subsets (or blocks). An iteration of ordered subsets EM is defined as a single pass through all the subsets, in each subset using the current estimate to initialize application of EM with that data subset. This approach is similar in concept to block-Kaczmarz methods introduced by Eggermont et al. (1981) for iterative reconstruction. Simultaneous iterative reconstruction (SIRT) and multiplicative algebraic reconstruction (MART) techniques are well known special cases. Ordered subsets EM (OS-EM) provides a restoration imposing a natural positivity condition and with close links to the EM algorithm. OS-EM is applicable in both single photon (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). In simulation studies in SPECT, the OS-EM algorithm provides an order-of-magnitude acceleration over EM, with restoration quality maintained.},

abstract = {Pulmonary function testing is performed in children and infants with the aim of documenting lung development with age and making diagnoses of lung diseases. In children and infants with an established lung disease, pulmonary function is tested to assess the disease progression and the efficacy of therapy. It is difficult to carry out the measurements in this age group without disturbances, so obtaining results of good quality and reproducibility is challenging. Young children are often uncooperative during the examinations. This is partly related to their young age but also due to the long testing duration and the unpopular equipment. We address a variety of examination techniques for lung function assessment in children and infants in this review. We describe the measuring principles, examination procedures, clinical findings and their interpretation, as well as advantages and limitations of these methods. The comparability between devices and centres as well as the availability of reference values are still considered a challenge in many of these techniques. In recent years, new technologies have emerged allowing the assessment of lung function not only on the global level but also on the regional level. This opens new possibilities for detecting regional lung function heterogeneity that might lead to a better understanding of respiratory pathophysiology in children.},

abstract = {As the use of realistic geometry in the forward model of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) of brain function appears to improve image reconstruction, the generation of patient-specific finite element meshes has been the subject of much recent work. This paper presents a more rapid method of generating more geometrically accurate finite element meshes of the human head by warping existing meshes such that the surface boundary beneath the electrodes closely matches that of the subject with minimal degradation to the quality of the mesh. Pre-existing meshes of spheres and adult head models incorporating key internal anatomical features are warped, using elastic deformation, to match a phantom latex tank incorporating a real skull. The algorithm is described and tests are carried out to optimize the key parameters to ensure minimal degradation of mesh quality and distortion of internal features. Results show that the algorithm operating with the optimum parameters produces meshes of sound quality and could represent an important step in the timely and productive creation of forward models in clinical applications.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is a recently developed imaging technique that combines MRI and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). In MREIT, cross-sectional electrical conductivity images are reconstructed from the internal magnetic field density data produced inside an electrically conducting object when an electrical current is injected into the object. In this work we present the results of electrical conductivity imaging experiments, and performance evaluations of MREIT in terms of noise characteristics and spatial resolution. The MREIT experiment was performed with a 3.0 Tesla MRI system on a phantom with an inhomogeneous conductivity distribution. We reconstructed the conductivity images in a 128 x 128 matrix format by applying the harmonic B(z) algorithm to the z-component of the internal magnetic field density data. Since the harmonic B(z) algorithm uses only a single component of the internal magnetic field data, it was not necessary to rotate the object in the MRI scan. The root mean squared (RMS) errors of the reconstructed images were between 11\% and 35\% when the injection current was 24 mA.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Critical care represents a large percentage of healthcare spending in developed countries. Yet, little is known regarding international variation in critical care services. We sought to understand differences in critical care delivery by comparing data on the distribution of services in eight countries. DESIGN: Retrospective review of existing national administrative data. We identified sources of data in each country to provide information on acute care hospitals and beds, intensive care units and beds, intensive care admissions, and definitions of intensive care beds. Data were all referenced and from as close to 2005 as possible. SETTING: United States, France, United Kingdom, Canada, Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, and Spain. PATIENTS: Not available. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: No standard definition existed for acute care hospital or intensive care unit beds across countries. Hospital beds varied three-fold from 221/100,000 population in the United States to 593/100,000 in Germany. Adult intensive care unit beds also ranged seven-fold from 3.3/100,000 population in the United Kingdom to 24.0/100,000 in Germany. Volume of intensive care unit admissions per year varied ten-fold from 216/100,000 population in the United Kingdom to 2353/100,000 in Germany. The ratio of intensive care unit beds to hospital beds was highly correlated across all countries except the United States (r = .90). There was minimal correlation between the number of intensive care unit beds per capita and health care spending per capita (r = .45), but high inverse correlation between intensive care unit beds and hospital mortality for intensive care unit patients across countries (r = -.82). CONCLUSIONS: Absolute critical care services vary dramatically between countries with wide differences in both numbers of beds and volume of admissions. The number of intensive care unit beds per capita is not strongly correlated with overall health expenditure, but does correlate strongly with mortality. These findings demonstrate the need for critical care data from all countries, as they are essential for interpretation of studies, and policy decisions regarding critical care services.},

abstract = {In 2009, prostate cancer ranked as the most common cancer and the second most fatal cancer in men in the United States. Unfortunately, the current clinical diagnostic methods (e.g. prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination, endorectal MRI, transrectal ultrasound, biopsy) used for detecting and staging prostate cancer are limited. It has been shown that cancerous prostate tissue has significantly different electrical properties when compared to benign tissues. Based on these electrical property findings, a transrectal electrical impedance tomography (TREIT) system is proposed as a novel prostate imaging modality. The TREIT system comprises an array of electrodes interfaced with a clinical transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe. We evaluate this imaging system through a series of phantom imaging experiments to assess the system's ability to image high and low contrast objects at various positions. We found that the TREIT system can easily discern high contrast inclusions of 1 cm in diameter at distances centered at two times the radius of the TREIT probe away from the probe surface. Furthermore, this technology's ability to detect low contrast inclusions suggests that it has the potential to successfully detect prostate cancer.},

abstract = {We investigated five different methods which can be applied to quantitatively construct functional tomograms of the lungs. The focus was on the sensitivity of functional tomograms to errors in acquired data. To quantify this sensitivity, theoretical, error-free data sets of well-known properties were artificially generated based on a 'living thorax model'. Physiological time courses and a typical distribution of errors caused by a typical Goe-MF II EIT system were used for the calculations which encompassed a range up to 50 times greater than the initial error level (4 microV(rms max)-400 microV(rms max)). Additionally, low-pass filtering and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to quantify the effect of preprocessing the raw data. The results demonstrate that all methods based on fitting the local to the global time course were superior to the common functional tomograms utilizing standard deviation or maximum and minimum detection. Ventilation distribution was best quantified by the so-called VT methods. Filling capacity--a lung tissue property--was least dependent on increasing error levels. The errors introduced by filtering are significant with respect to a quantitative analysis of ventilation distribution. A preprocessing of raw data by applying a PCA performed well on the data sets which had been constructed but were, nonetheless, realistic. This approach appears to be highly promising for application on real data which is known to be erroneous.},

abstract = {We have deployed a recently completed spectroscopic electrical impedance tomography (EITS) imaging system in a small series of women (13 participants accrued to date) in order to investigate the feasibility of delivering EITS breast examinations on a routine basis. Hardware is driven with sinusoidally varying spatial patterns of applied voltage delivered to 16 electrodes over the 10 kHz to 1 MHz spectral range using a radially translating interface which couples the electrodes to the breast through direct contact. Imaging examinations have consisted of the acquisition of multi-channel measurements at ten frequencies on both breasts. Participants lie prone on an examination table with the breast to be imaged pendant in the electrode array that is located below the table. Examinations were comfortable and easy to deliver (about 10 minutes per breast including electrode-positioning time). Although localized near-surface electrode artefacts are evident in the acquired images, several findings have emerged. Permittivity images have generally been more informative than their conductivity counterparts, except in the case of fluid-filled cysts. Specifically, the mammographically normal breast appears to have characteristic absolute EITS permittivity and conductivity images that emerge across subjects. Structural features in the EITS images have correlated with limited clinical information available on participants with benign and malignant abnormality, cysts and scarring from previous lumpectomy and follow-up radiation therapy. Several cases from this preliminary experience are described.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Although surfactant replacement therapy is an established treatment in infant respiratory distress syndrome, the optimum strategy for ventilatory management before, during, and after surfactant instillation remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of surfactant and lung volume recruitment on the distribution of regional lung ventilation. METHODS: Acute lung injury was induced in 16 newborn piglets by endotracheal lavage. Optimum positive end-expiratory pressure was identified after lung recruitment and surfactant was administered either at this pressure in the "open" lung or after disconnection of the endotracheal tube in the "closed" lung. An additional recruitment maneuver with subsequent optimum end-expiratory pressure finding was executed in eight animals; in the remaining eight animals, end-expiratory pressure was set at the same level as before surfactant without further recruitment. ("Open" and "closed" lung surfactant administration was evenly distributed in the groups.) Regional ventilation was assessed by electrical impedance tomography. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Impedance tomography data, airway pressure, flow, and arterial blood gases were acquired during baseline conditions, after induction of lung injury, after the first lung recruitment, and before as well as 10 and 60 min after surfactant administration. Significant shift in ventilation toward the dependent lung regions and less asymmetry in the right-to-left lung ventilation distribution occurred in the postsurfactant period when an additional recruitment maneuver was performed. Surfactant instillation in an "open" versus "closed" lung did not influence ventilation distribution in a major way. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial distribution of ventilation in the lavaged lung is modified by a recruitment maneuver performed after surfactant administration.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new pipeline for the fast and accurate segmentation of impedance images of the lungs using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is an emerging, promising, non-invasive imaging modality that produces real-time, low spatial but high temporal resolution images of impedance inside a body. Recovering impedance itself constitutes a nonlinear ill-posed inverse problem, therefore the problem is usually linearized, which produces impedance-change images, rather than static impedance ones. Such images are highly blurry and fuzzy along object boundaries. We provide a mathematical reasoning behind the high suitability of the Kalman filter when it comes to segmenting and tracking conductivity changes in EIT lung images. Next, we use a two-fold approach to tackle the segmentation problem. First, we construct a global lung shape to restrict the search region of the Kalman filter. Next, we proceed with augmenting the Kalman filter by incorporating an adaptive foreground detection system to provide the boundary contours for the Kalman filter to carry out the tracking of the conductivity changes as the lungs undergo deformation in a respiratory cycle. The proposed method has been validated by using performance statistics such as misclassified area, and false positive rate, and compared to previous approaches. The results show that the proposed automated method can be a fast and reliable segmentation tool for EIT imaging.},

While the spatial resolution of these images is relatively low, the temporal resolution of EIT data can be high. Most EIT reconstruction algorithms solve each data frame independently, although Kalman filter algorithms track the image changes across frames. This paper proposes a new approach which directly accounts for correlations between images in successive data frames. Image reconstruction is posed in terms of an augmented image x and measurement vector y, which concatenate the values from the d previous and future frames. Image reconstruction is then based on an augmented regularization matrix R, which accounts for a model of both the spatial and temporal correlations between image elements. Results are compared for reconstruction algorithms based on independent frames, Kalman filters and the proposed approach. For low values of the regularization hyperparameter, the proposed approach performs similarly to independent frames, but for higher hyperparameter values, it uses adjacent frame data to reduce reconstructed image noise.},

One key difficulty with EIT measurements is due to the movement and position uncertainty of the electrodes, especially due to breathing and posture change. In this paper, we develop an approach to reconstruct both the conductivity change image and the electrode movements from the temporal sequence of EIT measurements. Since both the conductivity change and electrode movement are slow with respect to the data frame rate, there are significant temporal correlations which we formulate as priors for the regularized image reconstruction model. Image reconstruction is posed in terms of a regularization matrix and a Jacobian matrix which are augmented for the conductivity change and electrode movement, and then further augmented to concatenate the d previous and future frames. Results are shown for simulation, phantom and human data, and show that the proposed algorithm yields improved resolution and noise performance in comparison to a conventional one-step reconstruction method.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This prospective observational study was conducted to describe the nature of the intensive care population across Ireland, identify adherence to international benchmarks of practice, and describe patient outcomes in critically ill patients. METHODS: A prospective observational multicentre study of demographics and organ failure incidence was carried out over a 10-week period in 2006 across the intensive care units (ICUs) of 14 hospitals in both the Republic and Northern Ireland. RESULTS: In total, there were 1,029 patient episodes entered across 14 ICUs. Emergency admissions accounted for 70\% of episodes. Admissions after major elective surgery accounted for 20.5\% of admissions. The mean length of ICU stay was 5.7 days, with a median of 2 days. Severe sepsis was identified in 35\% of patients during their ICU admission. Mechanical ventilation was used in 70.7\% of all patients admitted, of whom 26.9\% had acute lung injury. Acute kidney injury occurred in 28\% of all patients. Interhospital transfers were undertaken in 85 (8.3\%) patients. The overall intensive care mortality of the study population was 19\%. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive care medicine in Ireland serves a patient population with high requirement for mechanical ventilation and support of the function of multiple organs. The overall mortality compares favourably with international benchmarks.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Respiratory motion of lung lesions is a limiting factor of quantification of positron emission tomography (PET) data. As some important applications of PET such as therapy monitoring and radiation therapy treatment planning require precise quantification, it is necessary to correct PET data for motion artefacts. METHODS: The method is based on list-mode data. First, the motion of the lesion was detected by a centre of mass approach. In the second step, data were sorted corresponding to the breathing state. A volume of interest (VOI) around the lesion was defined manually, and the motion of the lesion in this VOI was measured with reference to the end-expiration image. Then, all voxels in the VOI were shifted according to the measured lesion motion. After optimisation of parameters and verification of the method using a computer-controlled motion phantom, it was applied to nine patients with solitary lesions of the lung. RESULTS: Fifty percent difference in measured lesion volume and 26\% in mean activity concentration were found comparing PET data before and after applying the correction algorithm when simulating a motion amplitude of 28 mm in phantom studies. For patients, maximum changes of 27\% in volume and 13\% in mean standardised uptake values (SUV) were found. CONCLUSION: As respiratory motion is affecting quantification of PET images, correction algorithms are essential for applications that require precise quantification. We described a method which improves the quantification of moving lesions by a local motion correction using list-mode data without increasing acquisition time or reduced signal-to-noise ratio of the images.},

abstract = {In current clinical practice, the primary diagnostic method for testing for prostate cancer is ultrasound-guided biopsy. In this paper, we consider using a sonolucent array of electrodes, printed on a thin Kapton layer and positioned on the imaging window of a transrectal ultrasound probe, as a method for providing coregistered electrical and ultrasound imaging of the prostate. As the electrical properties of malignant tissues have been shown to differ significantly from benign tissues, the estimation of the electrical properties is expected to be helpful in distinguishing certain beginning pathologies from cancer and in improving the detection rate that current biopsy methods provide. One of the main difficulties in estimating electrical properties of tissues with this electrode configuration is the rapid decay of the sensitivity with distance from the sensing array. In order to partially overcome this difficulty, we propose to use prior information from the ultrasound (US). Specifically we intend to delineate the boundaries of the prostate from the US, to subdivide the organ into a small number of voxels and to estimate the conductivity as constant on each of these subvolumes. We use a 3D forward model based on the finite element method for studying the sensitivity of a simulated segmented prostate for three different electrode array designs. The three designs present different electrode areas and inter-electrode gaps. Larger electrodes are desirable as they present a better contact, but we show that as they result in smaller inter-electrode gaps, shunting currents can be significant and the sensitivity is reduced. Because our clinical measurement system employs a single current source, we consider tetrapolar measurement patterns for evaluating these electrode configurations. Optimal measurement patterns are well defined for adaptive systems, where multiple currents are injected at the same time. For the electrode array designs we consider, which are three dimensional, there are no established systematic methods for forming sets of linearly independent tetrapolar measurement patterns. We develop a novel method for automatically computing a full set of independent tetrapolar measurement patterns that maximizes the sensitivity in a region of interest (ROI). We use these patterns in the forward modeling and sensitivity studies. In addition to the electrode arrays on the probe, we study the use of a further configuration, where a distal electrode is positioned on the exterior of the body and used for current injection.},

abstract = {Respiratory motion is a source of artefacts and reduced image quality in PET. Proposed methodology for correction of respiratory effects involves the use of gated frames, which are however of low signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore a method accounting for respiratory motion effects without affecting the statistical quality of the reconstructed images is necessary. We have implemented an affine transformation of list mode data for the correction of respiratory motion over the thorax. The study was performed using datasets of the NCAT phantom at different points throughout the respiratory cycle. List mode data based PET simulated frames were produced by combining the NCAT datasets with a Monte Carlo simulation. Transformation parameters accounting for respiratory motion were estimated according to an affine registration and were subsequently applied on the original list mode data. The corrected and uncorrected list mode datasets were subsequently reconstructed using the one-pass list mode EM (OPL-EM) algorithm. Comparison of corrected and uncorrected respiratory motion average frames suggests that an affine transformation in the list mode data prior to reconstruction can produce significant improvements in accounting for respiratory motion artefacts in the lungs and heart. However, the application of a common set of transformation parameters across the imaging field of view does not significantly correct the respiratory effects on organs such as the stomach, liver or spleen.},

abstract = {Attenuation correction (AC) of PET images with helical CT (HCT) in PET/CT matches only the spatial resolution of CT and PET, not the temporal resolution. We therefore proposed the use of respiration-averaged CT (ACT) to match the temporal resolution of CT and PET and evaluated the improvement of tumor quantification in PET images of the thorax with ACT. METHODS: First, we examined 100 consecutive clinical PET/CT studies for the frequency and magnitude of misalignment at the diaphragm position between the HCT and the PET data. Patients were injected with 555-740 MBq of (18)F-FDG and scanned 1 h after injection. The HCT data were acquired at the following settings: 120 kV, 300 mA, pitch of 1.35:1, collimation of 8 x 1.25 mm, and rotation cycle of 0.5 s. Patients were instructed to hold their breath at midexpiration during HCT of the thorax. The PET acquisition was 3 min per bed. Second, we retrospectively analyzed studies of 8 patients (1 with esophageal cancer and 7 with lung cancer). Each study included regular PET/CT followed by 4-dimensional (4D) CT for radiation treatment planning. We compared the results of AC of the PET data with HCT and ACT. There were 13 tumors in these 8 patients. The 4D CT data were acquired at the following settings: 120 kV, 50-150 mA, cine duration of 1 breathing cycle plus 1 s, collimation of 8 x 1.25 mm, and rotation cycle of 0.5 s. The acquisition was taken when the patient was in the free-breathing state. We averaged the 10 phases of the 4D CT data to obtain ACT for AC of the PET data. Both the ACT and the HCT data were used for AC of the same PET data. RESULTS: There was a misalignment between the HCT and the PET data in 50 of 100 patient studies. In 34 studies, the misalignment was greater than 2 cm. In a comparison of HCT and ACT, 5 tumors had differences in standardized uptake values (SUV) between HCT-and ACT-attenuation-corrected PET of less than 20\%, and 4 tumors had differences in SUV of more than 50\%. The latter 4 tumors were found in the patient with esophageal cancer and in 2 of the patients with lung cancer. The PET data from these 3 patients had a misalignment of 2-4.5 cm relative to the HCT data. Breathing artifacts were significantly reduced by ACT. Seven of the 8 patients had a lower diaphragm position on HCT than on ACT, suggesting that the patients tended to hold a deeper breath during HCT than during ACT. CONCLUSION: The high rate of misalignment suggested a potential mismatch between the HCT and the PET data with the limited-breath-hold CT protocol. In the comparison of HCT and ACT, significant differences (>50\%) in SUV were attributable to different breathing states between HCT and PET. The PET data corrected by ACT did not show breathing artifacts, suggesting that ACT may be more accurate than HCT for AC of the PET data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate regional lung volume changes occurring during an inflation-deflation maneuver using high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. DESIGN: Prospective animal trial. SETTING: Animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS: Six Yorkshire swine. INTERVENTIONS: Electrical impedance tomography was used to quantify regional ventilation during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. The electrical impedance tomography-derived center of ventilation was used to describe the distribution of regional ventilation, whereas spectral analysis was used to describe regional ventilation-induced impedance changes. Lung injury was induced using surfactant lavage. Animals were transitioned to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and a slow inflation-deflation maneuver was performed by changing mean airway pressure by 5 cm H2O every 15 mins to a maximum mean airway pressure of 40 cm H2O. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The induction of lung injury was associated with a significant shift of the center of ventilation toward nondependent areas and an increase in shunt fraction (p < .001). During the following inflation-deflation maneuver using high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, inflation was associated with a shift of the center of ventilation from nondependent to dependent areas. Center of ventilation was significantly correlated with the shunt fraction (p < .001). Analyzing different lung layers along the gravitational axis separately, nondependent lung areas showed significantly decreased regional ventilation-induced impedance changes at higher pressures, suggesting overdistension, whereas dependent lung areas showed increased impedance changes, suggesting recruitment. The reverse was observed during deflation (all p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The center of ventilation during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation correlated with oxygenating efficiency as measured by the shunt fraction. Lung recruitment during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation produced a significant shift of regional ventilation toward dependent areas of the lung and led to overdistension of nondependent areas.},

abstract = {A new method has been developed for fast image-based measurements of the transmitted radiofrequency (RF) field. The method employs an actual flip-angle imaging (AFI) pulse sequence that consists of two identical RF pulses followed by two delays of different duration (TR(1) < TR(2)). After each pulse, a gradient-echo (GRE) signal is acquired. It has been shown theoretically and experimentally that if delays TR(1) and TR(2) are sufficiently short and the transverse magnetization is completely spoiled, the ratio r = S(2)/S(1) of signal intensities S(1) and S(2), acquired at the beginning of the time intervals TR(1) and TR(2), depends on the flip angle (FA) of applied pulses as r = (1 + n * cos(FA))/(n + cos(FA)), where n = TR(2)/TR(1). The method allows fast 3D implementation and provides accurate B(1) measurements that are highly insensitive to T(1). The unique feature of the AFI method is that it uses a pulsed steady-state signal acquisition. This overcomes the limitation of previous methods that required long relaxation delays between sequence repetitions. The method has been shown to be useful for time-efficient whole-body B(1) mapping and correction of T(1) maps obtained using a variable FA technique in the presence of nonuniform RF excitation.},

abstract = {A damaged zone is formed during the excavation of underground galleries, altering the rock properties. From a perspective of nuclear waste storage in deep geological sites, there is a clear interest to monitor the rock properties in such zones. We constructed electrical resistivity tomograms as a function of time to monitor the damaged area in gallery 04 of the Mont Terri underground rock laboratory (Switzerland). Measurements were performed using electrode rings surrounding the gallery. The experience showed a heterogeneous distribution of damages around the gallery and their fast formation after the excavation. Two main areas were concerned by damage formation, located in regions where the bedding was tangential to the excavated gallery. Such regions represented an extension of about 2 m along the gallery walls and reached a depth of 1.5 m. Main damages were created during the next months following the excavation process. Slight variations were still observed 3 yr after the excavation that may be related to the gallery environmental condition fluctuation. The method applied here demonstrates the interest to monitor the whole region surrounding excavated galleries dedicated to host nuclear wastes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of body and head positions on the spatial distribution of ventilation in nonintubated spontaneously breathing and mechanically ventilated infants using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study in a neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Ten spontaneously breathing (gestational age 38 weeks, postnatal age 13 days) and ten mechanically ventilated infants (gestational age 35 weeks, postnatal age 58 days). INTERVENTIONS: Supine and prone postures with different head positions (midline and rotated to the left and right side). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The distribution of ventilation in the chest cross-section was repeatedly determined from EIT data in each body/head position studied. During spontaneous breathing the tidal volumes in the left lung region were reduced in the supine posture with the head turned to the left as well as in the prone posture with the head rotated to either side when compared with the supine posture with the head in the midline position. During mechanical ventilation the tidal volumes in the left lung region were unaffected by the body and head position except for the prone posture combined with the leftward head rotation which reduced them. In both types of ventilation the tidal volumes in the right lung region were unaffected by the change in body/head position. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the spatial distribution of ventilation is influenced by the body and head position in spontaneously breathing infants. Prone posture with the leftward head rotation has the most prominent effect which is detectable even during mechanical ventilation.},

abstract = {Current density impedance imaging (CDII) is a new impedance imaging technique that can noninvasively measure the conductivity distribution inside a medium. It utilizes current density vector measurements which can be made using a magnetic resonance imager (MRI) (Scott , 1991). CDII is based on a simple mathematical expression for inverted Delta sigma / sigma = inverted Delta ln sigma, the gradient of the logarithm of the conductivity sigma, at each point in a region where two current density vectors J1 and J2 have been measured and J1 x J2 not equal 0. From the calculated inverted Delta ln sigma and a priori knowledge of the conductivity at the boundary, the logarithm of the conductivity ln sigma is integrated by two different methods to produce an image of the conductivity sigma in the region of interest. The CDII technique was tested on three different conductivity phantoms. Much emphasis has been placed on the experimental validation of CDII results against direct bench measurements by commercial LCR meters before and after CDII was performed.},

abstract = {We have adapted a SENSE-accelerated imaging technique to magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) in order to acquire data faster or improve spatial resolution without increasing the data acquisition time. We also designed and optimized an eight-channel, dedicated phased array coil for this application. The RF coil was designed as two planar arrays so that the open sides could accommodate the MREIT electrodes. A quasi-intrinsic decoupling scheme was used to minimize couplings between coil elements, and a restricted geometry optimization was applied to achieve high and uniform SNR within a given coil geometry and animal size. The impact of variability in the size of animals was also investigated in the optimization. This coil geometry provided approximately three times higher SNR at the center of a phantom when compared to a transmit/receive birdcage coil designed for MREIT of small animals. Therefore, the SNR was superior to the data acquired with volume coils even with three times SENSE acceleration. Both magnitude images and MREIT data were acquired from phantoms with and without SENSE acceleration, and the results were compared. The phantom studies demonstrated that conductivity maps can be reconstructed from MREIT data acquired with three times SENSE acceleration and that no discernible artifacts were observed when accelerated data acquisition was compared to non-accelerated data.},

abstract = {Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is an imaging technique used in conjunction with radiation therapy. For example CBCT is used to verify the position of lung cancer tumours just prior to radiation treatment. The accuracy of the radiation treatment of thoracic and upper abdominal structures is heavily affected by respiratory movement. Such movement typically blurs the CBCT reconstruction and ideally should be removed. Hence motion-compensated CBCT has recently been researched for correcting image artefacts due to breathing motion. This paper presents a new dual-modality approach where CBCT is aided by using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for motion compensation. EIT can generate images of contrasts in electrical properties. The main advantage of using EIT is its high temporal resolution. In this paper motion information is extracted from EIT images and incorporated directly in the CBCT reconstruction. In this study synthetic moving data are generated using simulated and experimental phantoms. The paper demonstrates that image blur, created as a result of motion, can be reduced through motion compensation with EIT.},

abstract = {A variety of biomedical imaging techniques such as optical and fluorescence tomography, electrical impedance tomography, and ultrasound imaging can be cast as inverse problems, wherein image reconstruction involves the estimation of spatially distributed parameter(s) of the PDE system describing the physics of the imaging process. Finite element discretization of imaged domain with tetrahedral elements is a popular way of solving the forward and inverse imaging problems on complicated geometries. A dual-adaptive mesh-based approach wherein, one mesh is used for solving the forward imaging problem and the other mesh used for iteratively estimating the unknown distributed parameter, can result in high resolution image reconstruction at minimum computation effort, if both the meshes are allowed to adapt independently. Till date, no efficient method has been reported to identify and resolve intersection between tetrahedrons in independently refined or coarsened dual meshes. Herein, we report a fast and robust algorithm to identify and resolve intersection of tetrahedrons within nested dual meshes generated by 8-similar subtetrahedron subdivision scheme. The algorithm exploits finite element weight functions and gives rise to a set of weight functions on each vertex of disjoint tetrahedron pieces that completely cover up the intersection region of two tetrahedrons. The procedure enables fully adaptive tetrahedral finite elements by supporting independent refinement and coarsening of each individual mesh while preserving fast identification and resolution of intersection. The computational efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by diffuse photon density wave solutions obtained from a single- and a dual-mesh, and by reconstructing a fluorescent inclusion in simulated phantom from boundary frequency domain fluorescence measurements.},

@article{Pikkemaat2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Currently, the monitoring of cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) is mainly performed using invasive techniques. Therefore, performing CO monitoring noninvasively by means of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) would be advantageous for intensive care. Our hypothesis was that, by means of EIT, it is possible to assess heart rate (HR) and to quantify changes in SV due to changes in ventilator settings.

METHODS:: CO (HR and SV) of 14 pigs (32-40 kg body weight) was changed by incremental increases in positive end-expiratory pressure levels (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm·H2O; ramp maneuver). This ramp maneuver was applied 4 times in each animal, yielding 43 evaluable single experiments. At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, SV was assessed by transpulmonary thermodilution using a PiCCO device. EIT data were acquired using a Dr\"{a}ger EIT Evaluation Kit 2.

RESULTS:: The EIT-based SV-related signal, ZSV (in [AU]), showed only a weak correlation (after excluding 2 measurements) with SVTTD of r = 0.58 (95\% confidence interval, 0.43-0.71). If ZSV is calibrated by the reference 1 time for each experiment (defined as SVEIT), the correlation is approximately 0.85 (95\% confidence interval, 0.78-0.90). A possible reason for the moderate correlation is the unexpected scaling pattern, leading to amplification of the cardiac impedance signal, found in some animals. The scaling is probably due to the imperfect reconstruction (i.e., a change of sensitivity) of the EIT images or to a change in the position of the heart.

CONCLUSIONS:: The hypothesis that EIT can be used to monitor CO and SV was confirmed, but further studies are required before this technique can be applied in clinical practice. HR was determined robustly and accurately. For SV monitoring, promising results were obtained in 80\% of the experiments. However, unexpected scaling of the cardiac EIT signal causing inaccurate estimation of SV remains an issue. Before robust assessment of SV by EIT is suitable for clinical practice, the cause of and compensation for undesired scaling effects need to be investigated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine the effect of the irregular spontaneous breathing pattern and posture on the spatial distribution of ventilation in neonates free from respiratory disease by the non-invasive imaging method of electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Scanning of spontaneously breathing neonates is the prerequisite for later routine application of EIT in babies with lung pathology undergoing ventilator therapy. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care unit at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve pre-term and term neonates (mean age: 23 days; mean body weight: 2,465 g; mean gestational age: 34 weeks; mean birth weight: 2,040 g). INTERVENTIONS: Change in body position in the sequence: supine, right lateral, prone, supine. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: EIT measurements were performed using the G\"{o}ttingen GoeMF I system. EIT scans of regional lung ventilation showing the distribution of respired air in the chest cross-section were generated during phases of rapid tidal breathing and deep breaths. During tidal breathing, 54.5+/-8.3\%, 55.2+/-10.5\%, 59.9+/-8.4\% and 54.2+/-8.5\% of inspired air (mean values +/- SD) were directed into the right lung in the supine, right lateral, prone and repeated supine postures respectively. During deep inspirations, the right lung ventilation accounted for 52.6+/-7.9\%, 68.5+/-8.5\%, 55.4+/-8.2\% and 50.5+/-6.6\% of total ventilation respectively. CONCLUSION: The study identified the significant effect of breathing pattern and posture on the spatial distribution of lung ventilation in spontaneously breathing neonates. The results demonstrate that changes in regional ventilation can easily be determined by EIT and bode well for the future use of this method in paediatric intensive care.},

@article{Brower2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most patients requiring mechanical ventilation for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) receive positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 to 12 cm of water. Higher PEEP levels may improve oxygenation and reduce ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause circulatory depression and lung injury from overdistention. We conducted this trial to compare the effects of higher and lower PEEP levels on clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: We randomly assigned 549 patients with acute lung injury and ARDS to receive mechanical ventilation with either lower or higher PEEP levels, which were set according to different tables of predetermined combinations of PEEP and fraction of inspired oxygen. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) PEEP values on days 1 through 4 were 8.3+/-3.2 cm of water in the lower-PEEP group and 13.2+/-3.5 cm of water in the higher-PEEP group (P<0.001). The rates of death before hospital discharge were 24.9 percent and 27.5 percent, respectively (P=0.48; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between groups, -10.0 to 4.7 percent). From day 1 to day 28, breathing was unassisted for a mean of 14.5+/-10.4 days in the lower-PEEP group and 13.8+/-10.6 days in the higher-PEEP group (P=0.50). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS who receive mechanical ventilation with a tidal-volume goal of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an end-inspiratory plateau-pressure limit of 30 cm of water, clinical outcomes are similar whether lower or higher PEEP levels are used.},

We then explain the workings of an algorithm that we have used to make images from electrical impedance data measured on the boundary of a circle in two dimensions. This algorithm is based on the method of least squares. It takes one step of a Newton's method, using a constant conductivity as an initial guess. Most of the calculations can therefore be done analytically. The resulting code is named NOSER, for Newton's One-Step Error Reconstructor. It provides a reconstruction with 496 degrees of freedom. The code does not reproduce the conductivity accurately (unless it differs very little from a constant), but it yields useful images. This is illustrated by images reconstructed from numerical and experimental data, including data from a human chest.},

In children and infants with an established lung disease, pulmonary function is tested to assess the disease progression and the efficacy of therapy. It is difficult to carry out the measurements in this age group without disturbances, so obtaining results of good quality and reproducibility is challenging. Young children are often uncooperative during the examinations. This is partly related to their young age but also due to the long testing duration and the unpopular equipment. We address a variety of examination techniques for lung function assessment in children and infants in this review. We describe the measuring principles, examination procedures, clinical findings and their interpretation, as well as advantages and limitations of these methods. The comparability between devices and centres as well as the availability of reference values are still considered a challenge in many of these techniques. In recent years, new technologies have emerged allowing the assessment of lung function not only on the global level but also on the regional level. This opens new possibilities for detecting regional lung function heterogeneity that might lead to a better understanding of respiratory pathophysiology in children.},

Different methods are feasible for respiratory gating. In this study seven gating methods were developed and tested on positron emission tomography (PET) listmode data. The results of seven patient studies were compared quantitatively with respect to motion and noise. (1) Equal and (2) variable time-based gating methods use only the time information of the breathing cycle to define respiratory gates. (3) Equal and (4) variable amplitude-based gating approaches utilize the amplitude of the respiratory signal. (5) Cycle-based amplitude gating is a combination of time and amplitude-based techniques. A baseline correction was applied to methods (3) and (4) resulting in two new approaches: Baseline corrected (6) equal and (7) variable amplitude-based gating. Listmode PET data from seven patients were acquired together with a respiratory signal. Images were reconstructed applying the seven gating methods. Two parameters were used to quantify the results: Motion was measured as the displacement of the heart due to respiration and noise was defined as the standard deviation of pixel intensities in a background region. The amplitude-based approaches (3) and (4) were superior to the time-based methods (1) and (2). The improvement in capturing the motion was more than 30\% (up to 130\%) in all subjects. The variable time (2) and amplitude (4) methods had a more uniform noise distribution among all respiratory gates compared to equal time (1) and amplitude (3) methods. Baseline correction did not improve the results. Out of seven different respiratory gating approaches, the variable amplitude method (4) captures the respiratory motion best while keeping a constant noise level among all respiratory phases.},

GATE, the Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission, encapsulates the Geant4 libraries to achieve a modular, versatile, scripted simulation toolkit adapted to the field of nuclear medicine. In particular, GATE allows the description of time-dependent phenomena such as source or detector movement, and source decay kinetics. This feature makes it possible to simulate time curves under realistic acquisition conditions and to test dynamic reconstruction algorithms. This paper gives a detailed description of the design and development of GATE by the OpenGATE collaboration, whose continuing objective is to improve, document and validate GATE by simulating commercially available imaging systems for PET and SPECT. Large effort is also invested in the ability and the flexibility to model novel detection systems or systems still under design. A public release of GATE licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License can be downloaded at http://www-lphe.epfl.ch/GATE/. Two benchmarks developed for PET and SPECT to test the installation of GATE and to serve as a tutorial for the users are presented. Extensive validation of the GATE simulation platform has been started, comparing simulations and measurements on commercially available acquisition systems. References to those results are listed. The future prospects towards the gridification of GATE and its extension to other domains such as dosimetry are also discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is capable of monitoring regional lung recruitment and lung collapse during a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) trial. DESIGN: Experimental animal study of acute lung injury. SUBJECT: Six pigs with saline-lavage-induced acute lung injury. INTERVENTIONS: An incremental and decremental PEEP trial at ten pressure levels was performed. Ventilatory, gas exchange, and hemodynamic parameters were automatically recorded. EIT and computed tomography (CT) scans of the same slice were simultaneously taken at each PEEP level. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: A significant correlation between EIT and CT analyses of end-expiratory gas volumes (r=0.98 up to 0.99) and tidal volumes (r=0.55 up to r=0.88) could be demonstrated. Changes in global and regional tidal volumes and arterial oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) demonstrated recruitment/derecruitment during the trial, but at different onsets. During the decremental trial, derecruitment first occurred in dependent lung areas. This was indicated by lowered regional tidal volumes measured in this area and by a decrease of PaO2/FiO2. At the same time, the global tidal volume still continued to increase, because the increase of ventilation of the non-dependent areas was higher than the loss in the dependent areas. This indicates that opposing regional changes might cancel each other out when combined in a global parameter. CONCLUSIONS: EIT is suitable for monitoring the dynamic effects of PEEP variations on the regional change of tidal volume. It is superior to global ventilation parameters in assessing the beginning of alveolar recruitment and lung collapse.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is able to detect variations in regional lung electrical impedance associated with changes in both air and blood content and potentially capable of assessing regional ventilation-perfusion relationships. However, regional lung perfusion is difficult to determine because the impedance changes synchronous with the heart rate are of very small amplitude. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to determine the redistribution of lung perfusion elicited by one-lung ventilation using EIT with a novel region-of-interest analysis. Methods: Ten patients (65 +/- 9 years, mean age +/- SD) scheduled for elective chest surgery were studied after intubation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube during bilateral and unilateral ventilation of the right and left lungs. EIT data were acquired at a rate of 25 scans/s. Relative impedance changes synchronous with the heart rate were evaluated in the right and left lung regions. RESULTS: During bilateral ventilation, the mean right-to-left lung ratio of the sum of heart rate-related impedance changes was 1.12 +/- 0.20, but the ratio significantly changed (0.81 +/- 0.16 and 1.48 +/- 0.37) during unilateral left- and right-lung ventilation with reduced perfusion of the non-ventilated lung. Increased perfusion most likely occurred in the ventilated lung because the impedance values summed over both regions did not change (0.62 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.58 +/- 0.22) compared with bilateral ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that redistribution of regional lung perfusion can be assessed by EIT during one-lung ventilation. The performance of EIT in detecting changes in lung perfusion in even smaller lung regions remains to be established.},

@article{Blachere2000,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We compared helical CT angiography and ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scanning as initial tests in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred sixteen consecutive patients who were clinically suspected of having acute pulmonary embolism underwent helical CT angiography, ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scanning, and Doppler sonography of the veins of the legs. On the basis of concordance of the results for ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scanning and helical CT angiography and on the degree of clinical suspicion, certain patients underwent pulmonary angiography. Patients without pulmonary embolism at initial evaluation in whom no treatment was instituted were followed up for at least 3 months to determine the potential recurrence of thromboembolic disease. RESULTS: Of the 216 patients, 37 (17\%) were excluded because of insufficient data to assess the initial event. Final diagnosis for the 179 remaining patients was pulmonary embolism in 68 (37.9\%) and no pulmonary embolism in 111 (62.0\%), based on pulmonary angiography in 23 patients (12.8\%) and concordant imaging findings and outcome in the remaining patients. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found between sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for helical CT angiography and ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scanning (94.1\% versus 80.8\%; 93.6\% versus 73.8\%; 95.5\% versus 82\%; and 96.2\% versus 75.9\%, respectively). Interobserver agreement was excellent for helical CT angiography (kappa = 0.72) and moderate for ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scanning (kappa = 0.22). CONCLUSION: Helical CT angiography could replace ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scanning as the initial test for screening patients who are clinically suspected of having pulmonary embolism.},

abstract = {Emission tomography provides three-dimensional, quantitative images of the distribution of radiotracers used to mark physiological, metabolic, or pathological processes. Quantitative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) requires correction for the image-degrading effects due to photon attenuation and scatter. Phantom experiments have shown that radioactive concentrations can be assessed within some percentage of the true value when relevant corrections are applied. SPECT is widely spread, and radiotracers are available that are easy to use and comparably inexpensive. Compared with other methods, SPECT suffers from a lower spatial resolution, and the time required for image acquisition is longer than for some alternative methods. In contrast to some other methods, SPECT allows simultaneous imaging of more than one process, e.g., both regional blood flow and ventilation, for the whole lung. SPECT has been used to explore the influence of posture and clinical interventions on the spatial distribution of lung blood flow and ventilation. Lung blood flow is typically imaged using macroaggregates of albumin. Both radioactive gases and particulate aerosols labeled with radioactivity have been used for imaging of regional ventilation. However, all radiotracers are not equally suited for quantitative measurements; all have specific advantages and limitations. With SPECT, both blood flow and ventilation can be marked with radiotracers that remain fixed in the lung tissue, which allows tracer administration during conditions different from those at image registration. All SPECT methods have specific features that result from the used radiotracer, the manner in which it is administered, and how images are registered and analyzed.},

abstract = {The electric properties (EPs) of brain tissues, i.e., the electric conductivity and permittivity, can provide important information for diagnosis of various brain disorders. A high-field MRI system is accompanied by significant wave propagation effects, and the radio frequency (RF) radiation is dependent on EPs of the biological tissue. Based on the measurement of the active transverse magnetic component of the applied RF field (known as B1-mapping technique), we have developed a dual-excitation algorithm, which uses two sets of measured B1 data, to noninvasively reconstruct the biological tissue's electric properties. A series of computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method on a 3-D head model within a birdcage coil and a transverse electromagnetic coil. Compared with other B1-mapping based reconstruction algorithms, our approach provides superior performance without the need for iterative computations. The present simulation results indicate good reconstruction of electric properties of brain tissues from noninvasive MRI B1 mapping.},

The generalized Tikhonov regularization methods have been popular in the so- lution of many inverse problems. The regularization matrices that are usually used with the Tikhonov method are more or less ad hoc and the implicit prior assumptions are, thus, in many cases inappropriate. In this paper, we propose an approach to the construction of the regularization matrix that conforms to the prior assumptions on the impedance distribution. The approach is based on the construction of an approximating subspace for the expected impedance distributions. It is shown by simulations that the reconstructions obtained with the proposed method are better than with two other schemes of the same type when the prior is compatible with the true object. On the other hand, when the prior is incompatible with the true object, the method will still give reasonable estimates.},

abstract = {An algorithm for objectively calculating the hyperparameter for linearized one-step electrical impedance tomography (EIT) image reconstruction algorithms is proposed and compared to existing strategies. EIT is an ill-conditioned problem in which regularization is used to calculate a stable and accurate solution by incorporating some form of prior knowledge into the solution. A hyperparameter is used to control the trade-off between conformance to data and conformance to the prior. A remaining challenge is to develop and validate methods of objectively selecting the hyperparameter. In this paper, we evaluate and compare five different strategies for hyperparameter selection. We propose a calibration-based method of objective hyperparameter selection, called BestRes, that leads to repeatable and stable image reconstructions that are indistinguishable from heuristic selections. Results indicate: (1) heuristic selections of hyperparameter are inconsistent among experts, (2) generalized cross-validation approaches produce under-regularized solutions, (3) L-curve approaches are unreliable for EIT and (4) BestRes produces good solutions comparable to expert selections. Additionally, we show that it is possible to reliably detect an inverse crime based on analysis of these parameters.},

Two key difficulties in EIT instrumentation make such monitoring difficult: (1) EIT data quality depends on good electrode contact and is sensitive to changes in contact quality, and (2) EIT electrodes are difficult and time consuming to place on patients. This paper presents the design and initial tests of an active electrode-based system to address these difficulties. Our active electrode EIT system incorporates an active electrode belt, a central voltage-driven current source, central analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters, a central FPGA-based demodulator and controller. The electrode belt is designed incorporating 32 active electrodes, each of which contains the electronic amplifiers, switches and associated logic. Tests show stable device performance with a convenient ease of use and good imaging ability in volunteer tests.},

abstract = {Breathing moves volumes of electrically insulating air into and out of the lungs, producing conductivity changes which can be seen by electrical impedance tomography (EIT). It has thus been apparent, since the early days of EIT research, that imaging of ventilation could become a key clinical application of EIT. In this paper, we review the current state and future prospects for lung EIT, by a synthesis of the presentations of the authors at the 'special lung sessions' of the annual biomedical EIT conferences in 2009-2011. We argue that lung EIT research has arrived at an important transition. It is now clear that valid and reproducible physiological information is available from EIT lung images. We must now ask the question: How can these data be used to help improve patient outcomes? To answer this question, we develop a classification of possible clinical scenarios in which EIT could play an important role, and we identify clinical and experimental research programmes and engineering developments required to turn EIT into a clinically useful tool for lung monitoring.},

abstract = {There has been a surge of interest in using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for monitoring regional lung ventilation, however, EIT is an ill-conditioned problem, and errors/noise in the boundary voltages can have an undesirable effect on the quality of the final image. Most EIT systems in clinical usage use serial data collection hence data used to create a single image will have been collected at different times. This paper presents a study of the resulting image distortion, and proposes a method for correcting this lag in situations where the frame rate is insufficient to prevent significant image degradation. Significant correlation between the standard deviation of the time dependent reciprocity error and time delay dLe between the reciprocal electrode combinations was found for both adult and neonate data. This was reduced when the data was corrected for dLe. Original and corrected data was reconstructed with the GREIT algorithm and visible differences were found for the neonate data. Ideally EIT systems should be run at a frame rate of at least 50 times the frequency of the dominant and interesting physiological signals. Where this is not practical, the intra-frame system timings should be determined and lag corrected for.},

The method can further identify tissue biomarkers by decomposing the spectral contributions of different photo-absorbing molecules of interest. In this work we investigate the performance of blind source unmixing methods and spectral fitting approaches in decomposing the contributions of fluorescent dyes from the tissue background, based on MSOT measurements in mice. We find blind unmixing as a promising method for accurate MSOT decomposition, suitable also for spectral unmixing in fluorescence imaging.

One of the keys to producing an accurate reconstructed image is the inclusion of prior information regarding the physical geometry of the object. To achieve this, many researchers have created tools for solving the forward problem by means of finite element methods (FEMs). These tools are limited, allowing only a set number of meshes to be produced from the geometric information of the object. There is a clear need for geometrical accurate FEM models to improve the quality of the reconstructed images. We present a commercial tool called IDEAS, which can be used to create FEM meshes for these models. The application of this tool is demonstrated by using segmented data from the human head to model impedance changes inside the head.},

abstract = {Xenon-enhanced computed tomography (Xe-CT) has been used to measure regional ventilation by determining the wash-in (WI) and wash-out (WO) rates of stable Xe. We tested the common assumption that WI and WO rates are equal by measuring WO-WI in different anatomic lung regions of six anesthetized, supine sheep scanned using multi-detector-row computed tomography (MDCT). We further investigated the effect of tidal volume, image gating (end-expiratory EE versus end-inspiratory EI), local perfusion, and inspired Xe concentration on this phenomenon. RESULTS: WO time constant was greater than WI in all lung regions, with the greatest differences observed in dependent base regions. WO-WI time constant difference was greater during EE imaging, smaller tidal volumes, and with higher Xe concentrations. Regional perfusion did not correlate with WI-WO. We conclude that Xe-WI rate can be significantly different from the WO rate, and the data suggest that this effect may be due to a combination of anatomic and fluid mechanical factors such as Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities set up at interfaces between two gases of different densities.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) estimates an image of change in electrical properties within a body from stimulations and measurements at surface electrodes. There is significant interest in EIT as a tool to monitor and guide ventilation therapy in mechanically ventilated patients. In lung EIT, the EIT inverse problem is commonly linearized and only changes in electrical properties are reconstructed. Early algorithms reconstructed changes in resistivity, while most recent work using the finite element method reconstructs conductivity. Recently, we demonstrated that EIT images of ventilation can be misleading if the electrical contrasts within the thorax are not taken into account during the image reconstruction process. In this paper, we explore the effect of the choice of the reconstructed electrical properties (resistivity or conductivity) on the resulting EIT images. We show in simulation and experimental data that EIT images reconstructed with the same algorithm but with different parametrizations lead to large and clinically significant differences in the resulting images, which persist even after attempts to eliminate the impact of the parameter choice by recovering volume changes from the EIT images. Since there is no consensus among the most popular reconstruction algorithms and devices regarding the parametrization, this finding has implications for potential clinical use of EIT. We propose a program of research to develop reconstruction techniques that account for both the relationship between air volume and electrical properties of the lung and artefacts introduced by the linearization.},

abstract = {The use of imaging technologies has progressed beyond the depiction of anatomic abnormalities to providing non-invasive regional structure and functional information in intact subjects. These data are particularly valuable in studies of the lung, since lung disease is heterogeneous and significant loss of function may occur before it is detectable by traditional whole lung measurements such as oxygenation, compliance, or spirometry. While many imaging modalities are available, X-ray computed tomography (CT) is emerging as the preferred method for imaging the lung because of its widespread availability, resolution, high signal/noise ratio for lung tissue, and speed. Utilizing the quantitative density and dimensional information available from conventional CT images, it is possible to measure whole and regional lung volumes, distribution of lung aeration and recruitment behavior under various clinical conditions and interventions, and important regional mechanical properties. In addition, using the radiodense gas xenon (Xe) as a contrast agent, regional ventilation or gas transport may also be obtained. This communication will review recent advances in CT based techniques for the measurement of regional lung function.},

To this goal, the spatial transmit sensitivity distribution of the applied RF coil is measured. This sensitivity distribution represents the positive circularly polarized component of the magnetic field. It can be post-processed utilizing Faraday's and Ampere's law, yielding an estimation of the spatial distribution of the patient's electric conductivity. Thus, EPT does not apply externally mounted electrodes, currents, or RF probes. In this study, phantom experiments underline the principle feasibility of EPT. Furthermore, initial conductivity measurements in the brain allow distinguishing cerebro-spinal fluid from the surrounding grey and white matter.},

abstract = {Healthcare-associated infections (HCAI/HAI) represent a substantial threat to patient health during hospitalization and incur billions of dollars additional cost for subsequent treatment. One promising method for the detection of bacterial contamination in a clinical setting before an HAI outbreak occurs is to exploit native fluorescence of cellular molecules for a hand-held, rapid-sweep surveillance instrument. Previous studies have shown fluorescence-based detection to be sensitive and effective for food-borne and environmental microorganisms, and even to be able to distinguish between cell types, but this powerful technique has not yet been deployed on the macroscale for the primary surveillance of contamination in healthcare facilities to prevent HAI. Here we report experimental data for the specification and design of such a fluorescence-based detection instrument. We have characterized the complete fluorescence response of eleven clinically-relevant bacteria by generating excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) over broad wavelength ranges. Furthermore, a number of surfaces and items of equipment commonly present on a ward, and potentially responsible for pathogen transfer, have been analyzed for potential issues of background fluorescence masking the signal from contaminant bacteria. These include bedside handrails, nurse call button, blood pressure cuff and ward computer keyboard, as well as disinfectant cleaning products and microfiber cloth. All examined bacterial strains exhibited a distinctive double-peak fluorescence feature associated with tryptophan with no other cellular fluorophore detected. Thus, this fluorescence survey found that an emission peak of 340nm, from an excitation source at 280nm, was the cellular fluorescence signal to target for detection of bacterial contamination. The majority of materials analysed offer a spectral window through which bacterial contamination could indeed be detected. A few instances were found of potential problems of background fluorescence masking that of bacteria, but in the case of the microfiber cleaning cloth, imaging techniques could morphologically distinguish between stray strands and bacterial contamination.},

The dc current method used in magnetic resonance current density imaging is adopted. A reconstruction algorithm based on the sensitivity matrix relation between conductivity and only one component of magnetic flux distribution is used. Therefore, the requirement for object rotation is eliminated. Once the relative conductivity distribution is found, it is scaled using the peripheral voltage measurements to obtain the absolute conductivity distribution. Images of several insulator and conductor objects in saline filled phantoms are reconstructed. The L2 norm of relative error in conductivity values is found to be 13\%, 17\% and 14\% for three different conductivity distributions.},

Radiolabeled substrates are commonly used for in vitro measurements of SGLT activity in kidney cells. We optimized a method to measure glucose uptake using a fluorescent substrate, 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG).

METHODS: Uptake buffers for 2-NBDG were the same as for (14)C-labeled $\alpha$-methyl-d-glucopyranoside ([(14)C]AMG). Cell lysis buffer was optimized for fluorescence of 2-NBDG and Hoechst DNA stain. Uptake was performed on cultures of primary mouse kidney cells (PMKCs), the LLC-PK(1) proximal tubule cell line, or COS-7 cells transiently overexpressing mouse SGLT1 or SGLT2 by incubating cells at 37°C in buffer containing 50-200 $\mu$M 2-NBDG. Microscopy was performed to visualize uptake in intact cells, while a fluorescence microplate reader was used to measure intracellular concentration of 2-NBDG ([2-NBDG](i)) in cell homogenates.

RESULTS: Fluorescent cells were observed in cultures of PMKCs and LLC-PK(1) cells exposed to 2-NBDG in the presence or absence of Na(+). In LLC-PK(1) cells, 2-NBDG transport in the presence of Na(+) had a maximum rate of 0.05 nmol/min/$\mu$g of DNA. In these cells, Na(+)-independent uptake of 2-NBDG was blocked with the GLUT inhibitor, cytochalasin B. The Na(+)-dependent uptake of 2-NBDG decreased in response to co-exposure to the SGLT substrate, AMG, and it could be blocked with the SGLT inhibitor, phlorizin. Immunocytochemistry showed overexpression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 in COS-7 cells, in which, in the presence of Na(+), [2-NBDG](i) was fivefold higher than in controls.

CONCLUSION: Glucose transport in cultured kidney cells can be measured with the fluorescence method described in this study.},

abstract = {A multi-frequency electrical impedance tomography system for cardiopulmonary monitoring has been designed with specialized digital signal processors developed primarily for the telecommunications sector. The system consists of two modules: a scan-head and a base-station. The scan-head, located close to the patient's torso, contains front-end circuits for measuring transfer impedance with a 16-electrode array. The base-station, placed at the bedside, comprises 16 direct digital synthesizers, 32 digital down-converters, digital circuits to control the data acquisition sequence and a USB-2.0 microcontroller. At every step of the scan sequence, the system simultaneously measures four complex variables at eight frequencies. These variables are the potential difference between the selected pair of sense electrodes, the currents applied by the source and sink electrodes, and the current flowing through the ground electrode. Frequencies are programmable from 10 kHz to 2 MHz with a resolution of 2 mHz. Characterization tests were performed with a precision mesh phantom connected to the scan-head. For a 5 Hz frame rate, the mean signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy are, respectively, 43 dB and 95.4\% for eight frequencies logarithmically spaced from 70 to 950 kHz. In vitro and in vivo time-difference images have been reconstructed.},

abstract = {The dual-energy computed tomographic (CT) technique allows the differentiation of materials with large atomic numbers such as iodine and xenon. The basic principle of dual-energy CT is material decomposition based on attenuation differences at different energy levels. By using dual-energy CT angiography for the evaluation of perfusion defects in cases of pulmonary embolism, and using xenon CT for the evaluation of ventilation defects, it may be possible to replace perfusion and ventilation scanning. An iodine map from dual-energy CT can demonstrate the distribution of pulmonary perfusion, whereas xenon ventilation CT can be used to generate a ventilation map. Furthermore, the virtual nonenhanced dual-energy CT technique can be used for the evaluation of pulmonary nodule characteristics without acquisition of true nonenhanced CT images. Knowledge of the applications of dual-energy CT and the typical images produced may lead to wider use of dual-energy CT for pulmonary applications and better interpretation of the results.},

abstract = {Though well studied, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is still not fully understood. Mechanical ventilation (MV) has been a key treatment for ARDS. However, the optimal ventilation settings of basic MVparameters are still significantly debated. Only recently, were low tidal volumes shown to have lower mortality rates among ARDS patients. Despite over two decades of study, no standardisation of therapy or approach to MV appears on the horizon. This problem is likely due to the heterogeneity of the ARDS patient and ARDS affected lung. Currently, external MV parameters are set to try and treat an internal condition. There is no way to determine if more harm than good is being done. Hence, there is a tradeoff in between the risk of and benefit. What is required a method to assess that tradeoff and thus the potential risk. The use of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal volume has been identified as key ven- tilation parameters when treating ARDS patients. Although the impact of both parameters has been studied extensively, only the use of low tidal volumes has been conclusively determined. In contrast, the application of PEEP is still widely disputed. This review discusses two different approaches to ventilation management and the impact on optimal PEEP. The first approach examines the use of imaging techniques to determine regional lung mechanics. In the past, computed tomography (CT) was seen as a way to optimise PEEP, but the risks associated with it have limited it to a research tool. Newer methods such as lung ultrasound and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) seem to offer a less riskier approach to assessing regional mechanics. The second approach examines model-based approaches to ventilation management. Models that take ventilation data and depict a physical picture offer the potential to assess the risks on a patient-specific basis. Models offer the benefit of creating an approach to a highly heterogeneously and patient-specific problem in a non-invasive manner. Given the added dynamic of a patient’s evolution over time, a highly patient-specific approach is typical and also what is required. Although both approaches can potentially be used to help with clinical decision making with regard to PEEP, they both pose advantages and disad- vantages. The use of a given approach will depend on the individual needs of each clinic. Although not currently deployed in the clinic, model-based methods represent a novel methodology in treating ARDS patients. Thus, model-based approaches represent a “state of possible” rather than currently practiced methods, and require further clinical validation before justifying their use in the clinic.},

abstract = {In electrical impedance tomography (EIT) electric currents are injected into a body with unknown electromagnetic properties through a set of contact electrodes at the boundary of the body. The resulting voltages are measured on the same electrodes and the objective is to reconstruct the unknown conductivity function inside the body based on these data. All the traditional approaches to the reconstruction problem assume that the boundary of the body and the electrode-skin contact impedances are known a priori. However, in clinical experiments one usually lacks the exact knowledge of the boundary and contact impedances, and therefore, approximate model domain and contact impedances have to be used in the image reconstruction. However, it has been noticed that even small errors in the shape of the computation domain or contact impedances can cause large systematic artefacts in the reconstructed images, leading to loss of diagnostically relevant information. In a recent paper (Kolehmainen , 2006), we showed how in the 2-D case the errors induced by the inaccurately known boundary can be eliminated as part of the image reconstruction and introduced a novel method for finding a deformed image of the original isotropic conductivity using the theory of TeichmUller mappings. In this paper, the theory and reconstruction method are extended to include the estimation of unknown contact impedances. The method is implemented numerically and tested with experimental EIT data. The results show that the systematic errors caused by inaccurately known boundary and contact impedances can efficiently be eliminated by the reconstruction method.},

abstract = {Transrectal electrical impedance tomography (TREIT) has been proposed as an adjunct modality for enhancing standard clinical ultrasound (US) imaging of the prostate. The proposed TREIT probe has an array of electrodes adhered to the surface of a cylindrical US probe that is introduced inside of the imaging volume. Reconstructing TREIT images in the open-domain geometry established with this technique poses additional challenges to those encountered with closed-domain geometries, present in more conventional EIT systems, because of the rapidly decaying current densities at increasing distances from the probe surface. We developed a finite element method (FEM)-based dual-mesh reconstruction algorithm which employs an interpolation scheme for linking a fine forward mesh with a coarse grid of pixels, used for conductivity estimation. Simulation studies using the developed algorithm demonstrate the feasibility of imaging moderately contrasting inclusions at distances of three times the probe radius from the probe surface and at multiple angles about the probe's axis. The large, dense FEM meshes used here require significant computational effort. We have optimized our reconstruction algorithm with multi-core processing hardware and efficient parallelized computational software packages to achieve a speedup of 9.3 times when compared to a more traditional Matlab-based, single CPU solution. The simulation findings and computational optimization provide a state-of-the-art reconstruction platform for use in further evaluating transrectal electrical impedance tomography.},

Increased alveolar capillary membrane permeability was recognized as the common end organ injury and a central feature in all forms of ALI/ARDS. Although great strides have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS and in intensive care medicine, the treatment approach to ARDS is still relying on ventilatory and cardiovascular support based on the recognition of the clinical picture. In the course of evaluating novel treatment approaches to ARDS, 3 models of ALI induced in different species, i.e. the surfactant washout lavage model, the oleic acid intravenous injection model and the endotoxin injection model, were widely used. This review gives an overview of the pathological characteristics of these models from studies in pigs, dogs or sheep. We believe that a good morphological description of these models, both spatially and temporally, will help us gain a better understanding of the real pathophysiological picture and apply these models more accurately and liberally in evaluating novel treatment approaches to ARDS.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is expected to become a valuable tool for monitoring mechanically ventilated patients due to its ability to continuously assess regional lung ventilation and aeration. Several sources of interference with EIT examinations exist in intensive care units (ICU). Our objectives are to demonstrate how some medical nursing and monitoring devices interfere with EIT measurements and modify the EIT scans and waveforms, which approaches can be applied to minimize these effects and how possible misinterpretation can be avoided. We present four cases of EIT examinations of adult ICU patients. Two of the patients were subjected to pulsation therapy using a pulsating air suspension mattress while being ventilated by high-frequency oscillatory or conventional pressure-controlled ventilation, respectively. The EIT signal modulation synchronous with the occurrence of the pulsating wave was 2.3 times larger than the periodic modulation synchronous with heart rate and high-frequency oscillations. During conventional ventilation, the pulsating mattress induced an EIT signal fluctuation with a magnitude corresponding to about 20\% of the patient's tidal volume. In the third patient, interference with EIT examination was caused by continuous cardiac output monitoring. The last patient's examination was disturbed by impedance pneumography when excitation currents of similar frequency to EIT were used. In all subjects, the generation of functional EIT scans was compromised and interpretation of regional ventilation impossible. Discontinuation of pulsation therapy and of continuous cardiac output and impedance respiration monitoring immediately improved the EIT signal and scan quality. Offline processing of the disturbed data using frequency filtering enabled partial retrieval of relevant information. We conclude that thoracic EIT examinations in the ICU require cautious interpretation because of possible mechanical and electromagnetic interference.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Lung-protective ventilation aims at using low tidal volumes (VT) at optimum positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP). Optimum PEEP should recruit atelectatic lung regions and avoid tidal recruitment and end-inspiratory overinflation. We examined the effect of VT and PEEP on ventilation distribution, regional respiratory system compliance (C(RS)), and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) in an animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) and patients with ARDS by using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with the aim to assess tidal recruitment and overinflation.

METHODS: EIT examinations were performed in 10 anaesthetized pigs with normal lungs ventilated at 5 and 10 ml/kg body weight VT and 5 cmH2O PEEP. After ALI induction, 10 ml/kg VT and 10 cmH2O PEEP were applied. Afterwards, PEEP was set according to the pressure-volume curve. Animals were randomized to either low or high VT ventilation changed after 30 minutes in a crossover design. Ventilation distribution, regional C(RS) and changes in EELV were analyzed. The same measures were determined in five ARDS patients examined during low and high VT ventilation (6 and 10 (8) ml/kg) at three PEEP levels.

RESULTS: In healthy animals, high compared to low VT increased C(RS) and ventilation in dependent lung regions implying tidal recruitment. ALI reduced C(RS) and EELV in all regions without changing ventilation distribution. Pressure-volume curve-derived PEEP of 21±4 cmH2O (mean±SD) resulted in comparable increase in C(RS) in dependent and decrease in non-dependent regions at both VT. This implied that tidal recruitment was avoided but end-inspiratory overinflation was present irrespective of VT. In patients, regional C(RS) differences between low and high VT revealed high degree of tidal recruitment and low overinflation at 3±1 cmH2O PEEP. Tidal recruitment decreased at 10±1 cmH2O and was further reduced at 15±2 cmH(2)O PEEP.

CONCLUSIONS: Tidal recruitment and end-inspiratory overinflation can be assessed by EIT-based analysis of regional C(RS).},

@article{Barber1987,
abstract = {Resistance imaging involves the reconstruction of the distribution of electrical resistivity within a conducting object from measurements of the voltages or voltage gradients developed on the boundary of the object while current is flowing within the object. In general, the relationship between the distribution of resistivity in the object and the voltage profile on the object boundary is non-linear and attempts to reconstruct the distribution of resistivity from these profiles usually appear to involve time scanning iterative solutions. If it is assumed that the required resistivity distribution is close to a known reference distribution then it can be shown that there is an approximately linear relationship between the perturbation of the boundary voltage gradient measurements from those of the reference distribution and the logarithm of the resistivity perturbation from the reference distribution. The reconstruction problem then becomes solvable by linear methods. In particular it has proved possible to construct a single-pass back-projection method which can produce images of resistivity from a 16 electrode data collection system. Although the present implementation of this algorithm also assumes that the data is produced from a two-dimensional distribution of resistivity within a circular boundary and that the reference distribution is always uniform it seems capable of reconstructing useful images using data from three dimensional objects, including human subjects.},

We refer to this as nonnegative independent component analysis and we consider methods for solving this task. For independent sources with nonzero probability density function (pdf) p(s) down to s=0 it is sufficient to find the orthonormal rotation y=Wz of prewhitened sources z=Vx, which minimizes the mean squared error of the reconstruction of z from the rectified version y/sup +/ of y. We suggest some algorithms which perform this, both based on a nonlinear principal component analysis (PCA) approach and on a geodesic search method driven by differential geometry considerations. We demonstrate the operation of these algorithms on an image separation problem, which shows in particular the fast convergence of the rotation and geodesic methods and apply the approach to a musical audio analysis task.},

abstract = {The increasing use of EIT in clinical research on severely ill lung patients requires a clarification of the influence of pathologic impedance distributions on the validity of the resulting tomograms. Significant accumulation of low-conducting air (e.g. pneumothorax or emphysema) or well-conducting liquid (e.g. haematothorax or atelectases) may conflict with treating the imaging problem as purely linear. First, we investigated the influence of stepwise inflation and deflation by up to 300 ml of air and 300 ml of Ringer solution into the pleural space of five pigs on the resulting tomograms during ventilation at constant tidal volume. Series of EIT images representing relative impedance changes were generated on the basis of a modified Sheffield back projection algorithm and ventilation distribution was displayed as functional (f-EIT) tomograms. In addition, a modified simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) was applied to quantify the resistivity distribution on an absolute level scaled in Omega m (a-EIT). Second, we applied these two EIT techniques on four intensive care patients with inhomogeneous air and fluid distribution and compared the EIT results to computed tomography (CT) and to a reference set of intrathoracic resistivity data of 20 healthy volunteers calculated by SIRT. The results of the animal model show that f-EIT based on back projection is not disturbed by the artificial pneumo- or haematothorax. Application of SIRT allows reliable discrimination and detection of the location and amplitude of pneumo- or haematothorax. These results were supported by the good agreement between the electrical impedance tomograms and CT scans on patients and by the significant differences of regional resistivity data between patients and healthy volunteers.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) uses electrical measurements at electrodes placed around the thorax to image changes in the conductivity distribution within the thorax. This technique is well suited to studying pulmonary function because the movement of air, blood, and extravascular fluid induces significant conductivity changes within the thorax. We conducted three experimental protocols in a total of 19 dogs to assess the accuracy with which EIT can quantify changes in the volumes of both gas and fluid in the lungs. In the first protocol, lung volume increments from 50 to 1,000 ml were applied with a large syringe. EIT measured these volume changes with an average error of 27 +/- 6 ml. In the second protocol, EIT measurements were made at end expiration and end inspiration during regular ventilation with tidal volume ranging from 100 to 1,000 ml. The average error in the EIT estimates of tidal volume was 90 +/- 43 ml. In the third protocol, lung liquid volume was measured by instilling 5\% albumin solution into a lung lobe in increments ranging from 10 to 100 ml. EIT measured these volume changes with an average error of 10 +/- 10 ml and was also able to detect into which lobe the fluid had been instilled. These results indicate that EIT can noninvasively measure changes in the volumes of both gas and fluid in the lungs with clinically useful accuracy.},

abstract = {The completeness of tumor removal during surgery is dependent on the surgeon's ability to differentiate tumor from normal tissue using subjective criteria that are not easily quantifiable. A way to objectively assess tumor margins during surgery in patients would be of great value. We have developed a method to visualize tumors during surgery using activatable cell-penetrating peptides (ACPPs), in which the fluorescently labeled, polycationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) is coupled via a cleavable linker to a neutralizing peptide. Upon exposure to proteases characteristic of tumor tissue, the linker is cleaved, dissociating the inhibitory peptide and allowing the CPP to bind to and enter tumor cells. In mice, xenografts stably transfected with green fluorescent protein show colocalization with the Cy5-labeled ACPPs. In the same mouse models, Cy5-labeled free ACPPs and ACPPs conjugated to dendrimers (ACPPDs) delineate the margin between tumor and adjacent tissue, resulting in improved precision of tumor resection. Surgery guided by ACPPD resulted in fewer residual cancer cells left in the animal after surgery as measured by Alu PCR. A single injection of ACPPD dually labeled with Cy5 and gadolinium chelates enabled preoperative whole-body tumor detection by MRI, intraoperative guidance by real-time fluorescence, intraoperative histological analysis of margin status by fluorescence, and postoperative MRI tumor quantification. Animals whose tumors were resected with ACPPD guidance had better long-term tumor-free survival and overall survival than animals whose tumors were resected with traditional bright-field illumination only.},

@article{Segars2010,
abstract = {PURPOSE: The authors develop the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom for multimodality imaging research. METHODS: Highly detailed whole-body anatomies for the adult male and female were defined in the XCAT using nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and subdivision surfaces based on segmentation of the Visible Male and Female anatomical datasets from the National Library of Medicine as well as patient datasets. Using the flexibility of these surfaces, the Visible Human anatomies were transformed to match body measurements and organ volumes for a 50th percentile (height and weight) male and female. The desired body measurements for the models were obtained using the PEOPLESIZE program that contains anthropometric dimensions categorized from 1st to the 99th percentile for US adults. The desired organ volumes were determined from ICRP Publication 89 [ICRP, "Basic anatomical and physiological data for use in radiological protection: reference values," ICRP Publication 89 (International Commission on Radiological Protection, New York, NY, 2002)]. The male and female anatomies serve as standard templates upon which anatomical variations may be modeled in the XCAT through user-defined parameters. Parametrized models for the cardiac and respiratory motions were also incorporated into the XCAT based on high-resolution cardiac- and respiratory-gated multislice CT data. To demonstrate the usefulness of the phantom, the authors show example simulation studies in PET, SPECT, and CT using publicly available simulation packages. RESULTS: As demonstrated in the pilot studies, the 4D XCAT (which includes thousands of anatomical structures) can produce realistic imaging data when combined with accurate models of the imaging process. With the flexibility of the NURBS surface primitives, any number of different anatomies, cardiac or respiratory motions or patterns, and spatial resolutions can be simulated to perform imaging research. CONCLUSIONS: With the ability to produce realistic, predictive 3D and 4D imaging data from populations of normal and abnormal patients under various imaging parameters, the authors conclude that the XCAT provides an important tool in imaging research to evaluate and improve imaging devices and techniques. In the field of x-ray CT, the phantom may also provide the necessary foundation with which to optimize clinical CT applications in terms of image quality versus radiation dose, an area of research that is becoming more significant with the growing use of CT.},

This reconstruction approach helps to preserve discontinuities in reconstructed profiles, such as step changes in electrical properties at interorgan boundaries, which are typically smoothed by traditional reconstruction algorithms. The use of the TV functional for regularization leads to the minimization of a nondifferentiable objective function in the inverse formulation. This cannot be efficiently solved with traditional optimization techniques such as the Newton method. We explore two implementations methods for regularization with the TV functional: the lagged diffusivity method and the primal dual-interior point method (PD-IPM). First we clarify the implementation details of these algorithms for EIT reconstruction. Next, we analyze the performance of these algorithms on noisy simulated data. Finally, we show reconstructed EIT images of in vivo data for ventilation and gastric emptying studies. In comparison to traditional quadratic regularization, TV regularization shows improved ability to reconstruct sharp contrasts.},

abstract = {Detection of intrinsic or extrinsically administered chromophores and photo-absorbing nanoparticles has been achieved by Multi-Spectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT). The detection sensitivity of MSOT depends not only on the signal to noise ratio considerations, as in conventional optoacoustic (photoacoustic) tomography implementations, but also on the ability to resolve the molecular targets of interest from the absorbing tissue background by means of spectral un-mixing or sub-pixel detection methods. However, it is not known which un-mixing methods are optimally suited for the characteristics of multispectral optoacoustic images. In this work we investigated the performance of different sub-pixel detection methods, typically used in remote sensing hyperspectral imaging, within the context of MSOT. A quantitative comparison of the different algorithmic approaches was carried out in an effort to identify methods that operate optimally under the particulars of MSOT applications. We find that statistical sub-pixel detection methods can demonstrate a unique detection performance with up to five times enhanced sensitivity as compared to linear un-mixing approximations, under the condition that the optical agent of interest is sparsely present within the tissue volume, as common when using targeted agents and reporter genes.},

@article{Gattinoni2010,
abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last 2 years, several reports have dealt with recruitment/positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) selection. Most of them confirm previous results and few add new information.

RECENT FINDINGS: It has been definitely confirmed that opening pressures are different throughout the acute respiratory distress syndrome lung parenchyma, ranging from 5-10 up to 30-40 cmH2O. The highest opening pressures are required to open the most dependent lung regions. It has been found that in 2 s, most of the recruitable lung regions may be open when a proper pressure is applied. The best way to assess recruitment is computed tomography scanning, whereas lung mechanics are a reasonable bedside surrogate. Impedance tomography has been increasingly tested, whereas gas exchange is the less reliable indicator of recruitment. A large outcome study showed that higher PEEP might provide survival benefit in a subgroup of more severe patients as compared with lower PEEP. To set PEEP in each individual patient, the use of the expiratory limb of the pressure-volume curve has been suggested. Setting PEEP according to transpulmonary pressure has a robust physiological background, although it requires confirmatory study.

SUMMARY: Indiscriminate application of recruitment maneuver in unselected acute respiratory distress syndrome population does not provide benefits. However, in the most severe patients, recruitment maneuver has to be considered and higher PEEP applied. To individualize PEEP, the expiratory phase has to be considered, and the esophageal pressure measurement to compute the transpulmonary pressure should be progressively introduced in clinical practice.},

abstract = {There are a number of constraints which limit the current and voltages which can be applied on a multiple drive electrical imaging system. One obvious constraint is to limit the maximum ohmic power dissipated in the body. Current patterns optimizing distinguishability with respect to this constraint are singular functions of the difference of transconductance matrices with respect to the power norm (the optimal currents of Isaacson). If one constrains the total current (L1 norm) the optimal patterns are pair drives. On the other hand if one constrains the maximum current on each drive electrode (an L(infinity) norm), the optimal patterns have each drive channel set to the maximum source or sink current value. In this paper we consider appropriate safety constraints and discuss how to find the optimal current patterns with those constraints.},

abstract = {SUMMARY AT A GLANCE: Posture-dependent redistribution of regional ventilation was determined by electrical impedance tomography in healthy subjects during spontaneous tidal breathing and vital capacity manoeuvres. The ventilation distribution patterns within two examined chest cross-sections were dissimilar. The reproducibility of findings was good which is essential for future clinical follow-up examinations using this method. ABSTRACT: Background and objective:  Reliable assessment of regional lung ventilation and good reproducibility of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) data are the prerequisites for the future application of EIT in a clinical setting. The aims of our study were to determine 1) the reproducibility of repeated EIT measurements and 2) the effect of the studied transverse chest plane on ventilation distribution in different postures. Methods:  Ten healthy adult subjects were studied in three postures on two separate days. EIT and spirometric data were obtained during tidal breathing and slow vital capacity manoeuvres. EIT data were acquired in two chest planes at 13 scans/s. Reproducibility of EIT findings was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson correlation in 16 regions of interest in each plane. Regional ventilation distribution during tidal breathing and deep expiration was determined as fractional ventilation in four quadrants of the studied chest cross-sections. Results:  Our study showed a good reproducibility of EIT measurements repeated after an average time interval of 8 days. Global tidal volumes and vital capacities determined by spirometry on separate days were not significantly different. Regional ventilation in chest quadrants assessed by EIT was also unaffected. Posture exerted a significant effect on ventilation distribution among the chest quadrants during spontaneous breathing and deep expiration in both planes. The spatial distribution patterns in the two planes were not identical. Conclusions:  We conclude that regional EIT ventilation findings are reproducible and recommend that the EIT examination location on the chest is carefully chosen especially during repeated measurements and follow-up.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a badly posed inverse problem, but can be stabilized if one assumes that the conductivity is piecewise constant, with a relatively small number of distinct regions, and that the region boundaries are known, for example from prior anatomical imaging. With this assumption, we introduce a three-dimensional (3-D) boundary element method (BEM) model for the forward EIT map from injected currents to measured voltages, and 3-D inverse solutions for both BEM and the finite element method (FEM) which explicitly take into account the parameterization implied by the known boundary locations. We develop expressions for the Jacobians for both methods, since they are nonlinear, to more rapidly solve the inverse problem. We show simulation results in a torso geometry with the heart and lungs as inhomogeneities. In a simulation study, we could reconstruct the conductive values of some internal organs of a human torso with more than 92\% accuracy even with inaccurate internal boundary locations, a randomized rather than constant conductivity profile (with the standard deviation of the Gaussian-distributed conductivities set to 20\% of their mean values), signal to measurement noise of 50 dB, and with different meshes used for the forward and inverse problems. BEM and FEM perform similarly, leading to the conclusion that the choice between them should be based on secondary considerations such as computational efficiency or the need to model conductivity anisotropies.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measures the conductivity distribution within an object based on the current applied and voltage measured at surface electrodes. Thus, EIT images are sensitive to electrode properties (i.e. contact impedance, electrode area and boundary shape under the electrode). While some of these electrode properties have been investigated individually, this paper investigates these properties and their interaction using finite element method simulations and the complete electrode model (CEM). The effect of conformal deformations on image reconstruction when using the CEM was of specific interest. Observed artefacts were quantified using a measure that compared an ideal image to the reconstructed image, in this case a no-noise reconstruction that isolated the electrodes' effects. For electrode contact impedance and electrode area, uniform reductions to all electrodes resulted in ringing artefacts in the reconstructed images when the CEM was used, while parameter variations that were not correlated amongst electrodes resulted in artefacts distributed throughout the image. When the boundary shape changed under the electrode, as with non-symmetric conformal deformations, using the CEM resulted in structured distortions within the reconstructed image. Mean electrode contact impedance increases, independent of inter-electrode variation, did not result in artefacts in the reconstructed image.},

abstract = {The assessment of the regional match between alveolar ventilation and perfusion in critically ill patients requires simultaneous measurements of both parameters. Ideally, assessment of lung perfusion should be performed in real-time with an imaging technology which provides, through fast acquisition of sequential images, information about the regional dynamics or regional kinetics of an appropriate tracer. We present a novel electrical impedance tomography (EIT) based method that quantitatively estimates regional lung perfusion based on first-pass kinetics of a bolus of hypertonic saline contrast. Pulmonary blood flow was measured in six piglets during control and unilateral or bilateral lung collapse conditions. The first-pass kinetics method showed good agreement with the estimates obtained by single-photon-emission computerized tomography (SPECT). The mean difference (SPECT minus EIT) between fractional blood flow to lung areas suffering atelectasis was -0.6 \%, with a standard deviation of 2.9 \%. This method outperformed the estimates of lung perfusion based on impedance-pulsatility. In conclusion, we describe a novel method based on Electrical Impedance Tomography for estimating regional lung perfusion at the bedside. In both, healthy and injured lung conditions, the distribution of pulmonary blood flow as assessed by EIT agreed well with the one obtained by SPECT. The method proposed in this paper has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of regional perfusion under different lung and therapeutic conditions.},

abstract = {The measurement of regional lung ventilation by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been evaluated in many experimental studies. However, EIT is not routinely used in a clinical setting, which is attributable to the fact that a convenient concept for how to quantify the EIT data is missing. The definition of region of interest (ROI) is an essential point in the data analysis. To date, there are only limited data available on the different approaches to ROI definition to evaluate regional lung ventilation by EIT. For this survey we examined ten patients (mean age +/- SD: 60 +/- 10 years) under controlled ventilation. Regional tidal volumes were quantified as pixel values of inspiratory-to-expiratory impedance differences and four types of ROIs were subsequently applied. The definition of ROI contours was based on the calculation of the pixel values of (1) standard deviation from each pixel set of impedance data and (2) the regression coefficient from linear regression equations between the individual local (pixel) and average (whole scan) impedance signals. Additionally, arbitrary ROIs (four quadrants and four anteroposterior segments of equal height) were used. Our results indicate that both approaches to ROI definition using statistical parameters are suitable when impedance signals with high sensitivity to ventilation-related phenomena are to be analyzed. The definition of the ROI contour as 20-35\% of the maximum standard deviation or regression coefficient is recommended. Simple segmental ROIs are less convenient because of the low ventilation-related signal component in the dorsal region.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the plausibility, stability, and interindividual comparability of the global inhomogeneity index (GI) based on electrical impedance tomography (EIT). METHODS: The lung area in an EIT image was identified by using the lung area estimation method, which mirrors the lung regions in the functional EIT image and subsequently subtracts the cardiac-related areas. The tidal EIT image, showing the difference in impedances between end-inspiration and end-expiration, was calculated and the variations in its pixel values within the predefined lung area were then used as an indicator of inhomogeneous ventilation (the GI index). Fifty patients were investigated including 40 patients tracheally intubated with double-lumen tubes (test group) and 10 patients under anesthesia without pulmonary disease (control group). Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 mbar was applied in the test group during both two-lung ventilation (TLV) and subsequent one-lung ventilation (OLV). The patients of the control group were ventilated without PEEP. EIT data were recorded in both groups. RESULTS: A significantly lower GI value was found in the control group (0.40 +/- 0.05, P = 0.025 vs. TLV 0.74 +/- 0.47 and P < 0.002 vs. OLV 1.51 +/- 1.45). A significant difference was also found in the test group between TLV and OLV (P < 0.002). If GI was calculated only in the ventilated lung area during OLV (0.71 +/- 0.32), it did not significantly differ from the test group during TLV. CONCLUSIONS: The GI index quantifies the gas distribution in the lung with a single number and reveals good interpatient comparability.},

Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.},

The measurements were made between 23 and 25 °C using a network analyzer connected to a flat‐ended coaxial probe that was pressed against the freshly excised tissue samples. The malignant tissues were of the following normal tissue origin: bladder, colon, kidney, liver, lung, lymph nodes, mammary gland, spleen, and testes. The normal tissues included: colon, kidney, liver, lung, mammary gland, and muscle. Normal tissue samples of bladder, lymph, spleen, and testes were not available. In general, at all frequencies tested, both conductivity and relative permittivity were greater in malignant tissue than in normal tissue of the same type. For tissues of the same type, the differences in electrical properties from normal to malignant were the least for kidney (about 6\% and 4\% average differences over the frequency range in permittivity and conductivity, respectively), and these differences were the greatest for mammary gland (about 233\% and 577\% average differences in permittivity and conductivity, respectively). To illustrate a potential use of these data in hyperthermia applications, frequency‐selective heating of malignant tissue (modeled as a sphere) surrounded by host normal tissue is calculated from the measured electrical properties for certain tissues.},

abstract = {We propose a novel imaging system useful in dermatology, more precisely, for the follow-up of patients with an increased risk of skin cancer. The system consists of a Pentium PC equipped with an RGB frame grabber, a three-chip charge coupled devices (CCD) camera controlled by the serial port and equipped with a zoom lens and a halogen annular light source. Calibration of the imaging system provides a way to transform the acquired images, which are defined in an unknown color space, to a standard, well-defined color space called sRGB. sRGB has a known relation to the CIE1 XYZ and CIE L*a*b* colorimetric spaces. These CIE color spaces are based on the human vision, and they allow the computation of a color difference metric called CIE deltaE*ab, which is proportional to the color difference, as seen by a human observer. Several types of polynomial RGB to sRGB transforms will be tried, including some optimized in perceptually uniform color spaces. The use of a standard and well-defined color space also allows meaningful exchange of images, e.g., in teledermatology. The calibration procedure is based on 24 patches with known color properties, and it takes about 5 minutes to perform. It results in a number of settings called a profile that remains valid for tens of hours of operation. Such a profile is checked before acquiring images using just one color patch, and is adjusted on the fly to compensate for short-term drift in the response of the imaging system. Precision or reproducibility of subsequent color measurements is very good with (deltaE*ab) = 0.3 and deltaE*ab < 1.2. Accuracy compared with spectrophotometric measurements is fair with (deltaE*ab) = 6.2 and deltaE*ab < 13.3.},

abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography (MREIT) produces cross-sectional images of a conductivity distribution inside the human body. We use an MRI scanner as a tool to measure induced internal magnetic flux density distributions subject to externally injected currents. Recent experimental MREIT studies demonstrated conductivity image reconstructions of in vivo animal and human subjects with a few millimeter pixel size using 3 mA current injections. To enhance the clinical applicability of MREIT especially in neuroimaging applications, it is necessary to develop high-resolution MREIT techniques using low imaging currents. In this study, we demonstrate the capability of MREIT to perform conductivity imaging with less than 1 mA injection currents. The experimental results using a 3 T MRI scanner with a multi-echo ICNE pulse sequence and high-performance RF coils demonstrate that we can distinguish two different anomalies in reconstructed conductivity images with less than 1 mm pixel sizes. We plan to apply the developed experimental method to in vivo head imaging of small animals to investigate the feasibility of functional MREIT as a new neuro-imaging method.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Regional differences in lung volume have been described in adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome, but it remains unclear to what extent they occur in children. To quantify regional alveolar collapse that occurred during mechanical ventilation during a standardized suctioning maneuver, we evaluated regional and global relative impedance changes (relative DeltaZ) in children with acute respiratory distress syndrome using electrical impedance tomography. DESIGN: Prospective observational trial. SETTING: A 30-bed pediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Six children with acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: Standardized suctioning maneuver. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: By comparing layers from nondependent (layers 1 and 2) to dependent lung areas (layers 3 and 4), it was demonstrated that the middle layers (2 and 3) had the greatest ventilation-induced change in relative DeltaZ; layer 4 showed the least ventilation-induced change in relative DeltaZ. During suctioning, layers 1, 2, and 3 showed a negative change in relative DeltaZ, whereas layer 4 showed no significant change in relative DeltaZ. The derecruitment-induced change in relative DeltaZ representing the lung-volume loss was -9.8 (-3.0 mL/kg) during the first suctioning maneuver, -16.1 (-5.4 mL/kg) during the second, and -21.7 (-7.4 mL/kg) during the third. The ventilation-induced change in relative DeltaZ during mechanical ventilation remained unchanged after suctioning (mean change in relative DeltaZ before vs. after suctioning, 40.1 +/- 9.1 vs. 41.4 +/- 10.8; p = .30). Dynamic compliance was 11.8 +/- 6.1 mL.cm H2O before and 11.8 +/- 6.9 mL.cm H2O after the suctioning sequence (p = .90). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable regional heterogeneity was present during ventilation and a derecruitment maneuver. Significantly lower change in relative DeltaZ in the most dependent lung regions suggests alveolar collapse during ventilation before suctioning.},

abstract = {Emerging fluorescence and bioluminescence tomography approaches have several common, yet several distinct features from established emission tomographies of PET and SPECT. Although both nuclear and optical imaging modalities involve counting of photons, nuclear imaging techniques collect the emitted high energy (100-511 keV) photons after radioactive decay of radionuclides while optical techniques count low-energy (1.5-4.1 eV) photons that are scattered and absorbed by tissues requiring models of light transport for quantitative image reconstruction. Fluorescence imaging has been recently translated into clinic demonstrating high sensitivity, modest tissue penetration depth, and fast, millisecond image acquisition times. As a consequence, the promise of quantitative optical tomography as a complement of small animal PET and SPECT remains high. In this review, we summarize the different instrumentation, methodological approaches and schema for inverse image reconstructions for optical tomography, including luminescence and fluorescence modalities, and comment on limitations and key technological advances needed for further discovery research and translation.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is able to reflect physiological parameters such as real-time changes in global and regional lung volume. EIT can aid in the assessment of lung recruitment, and its use has been validated in preliminary studies monitoring mechanical ventilation at the bedside. ICU patients vary widely in their body habitus, and obesity is becoming more prevalent. Our primary research purpose was to establish whether anthropometric parameters influence EIT's reliability. Our secondary question was whether body position alters its correlation to spirometric measurements. SUBJECTS: 22 healthy adult volunteers (12 male, 10 female) with broadly variable anthropometric parameters. INTERVENTIONS: Simultaneous measurements of changes in lung volume using EIT imaging and a pneumotachograph were obtained with two breathing patterns (quiet and deep breathing) and in four body positions (standing, sitting, semi-reclining and supine). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Correlation between measurements of changes in lung volume using EIT imaging and a pneumotachograph was excellent. Variations attributable to anthropometric measurements accounted for at most a 1.3\% difference. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropometric variability and body position do not adversely influence the EIT estimation of changes in lung volume. These data suggest EIT could be used to monitor critically ill mechanically ventilated adults with variable body habitus regardless of position.},

@article{Arpinar2012,
abstract = {Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is a technique that produces images of conductivity in tissues and phantoms. In this technique, electrical currents are applied to an object and the resulting magnetic flux density is measured using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the conductivity distribution is reconstructed using these MRI data. Currently, the technique is used in research environments, primarily studying phantoms and animals. In order to translate MREIT to clinical applications, strict safety standards need to be established, especially for safe current limits. However, there are currently no standards for safe current limits specific to MREIT. Until such standards are established, human MREIT applications need to conform to existing electrical safety standards in medical instrumentation, such as IEC601. This protocol limits patient auxiliary currents to 100 µA for low frequencies. However, published MREIT studies have utilized currents 10-400 times larger than this limit, bringing into question whether the clinical applications of MREIT are attainable under current standards. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of MREIT to accurately reconstruct the relative conductivity of a simple agarose phantom using 200 µA total injected current and tested the performance of two MREIT reconstruction algorithms. These reconstruction algorithms used are the iterative sensitivity matrix method (SMM) by Ider and Birgul (1998 Elektrik 6 215-25) with Tikhonov regularization and the harmonic B(Z) proposed by Oh et al (2003 Magn. Reason. Med. 50 875-8). The reconstruction techniques were tested at both 200 µA and 5 mA injected currents to investigate their noise sensitivity at low and high current conditions. It should be noted that 200 µA total injected current into a cylindrical phantom generates only 14.7 µA current in imaging slice. Similarly, 5 mA total injected current results in 367 µA in imaging slice. Total acquisition time for 200 µA and 5 mA experiments was about 1 h and 8.5 min, respectively. The results demonstrate that conductivity imaging is possible at low currents using the suggested imaging parameters and reconstructing the images using iterative SMM with Tikhonov regularization, which appears to be more tolerant to noisy data than harmonic B(Z).},

abstract = {We present an imaging system based on light emitting diode (LED) illumination that produces multispectral optical images of the human ocular fundus. It uses a conventional fundus camera equipped with a high power LED light source and a highly sensitive electron-multiplying charge coupled device camera. It is able to take pictures at a series of wavelengths in rapid succession at short exposure times, thereby eliminating the image shift introduced by natural eye movements (saccades). In contrast with snapshot systems the images retain full spatial resolution. The system is not suitable for applications where the full spectral resolution is required as it uses discrete wavebands for illumination. This is not a problem in retinal imaging where the use of selected wavelengths is common. The modular nature of the light source allows new wavelengths to be introduced easily and at low cost. The use of wavelength-specific LEDs as a source is preferable to white light illumination and subsequent filtering of the remitted light as it minimizes the total light exposure of the subject. The system is controlled via a graphical user interface that enables flexible control of intensity, duration, and sequencing of sources in synchrony with the camera. Our initial experiments indicate that the system can acquire multispectral image sequences of the human retina at exposure times of 0.05 s in the range of 500-620 nm with mean signal to noise ratio of 17 dB (min 11, std 4.5), making it suitable for quantitative analysis with application to the diagnosis and screening of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.},

abstract = {The tomographic imaging of tissue's electrical properties (e.g., conductivity and permittivity) has been greatly improved by recent developments in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques, which include MR electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) and electrical property tomography. When the biological material is subjected to an external electric field, local changes in its electrical properties become sources of magnetic field perturbations, which are detectable by the MR signals. Controlling the external excitation and measuring the responses using an MRI scanner, we can formulate the imaging problem as an inverse problem in which unknown tissue properties are recovered from the acquired MR signals. This inverse problem is nonlinear; it involves the incorporation of Maxwell's equations and Bloch equations during data acquisition. Each method for visualizing internal conductivity and permittivity distributions has its own methodological limitations, and is restricted to imaging only a part of the ensemble or mean tissue structures or states. Therefore, imaging methods can be improved by developing complementary methods that can employ the beneficial aspects of various existing techniques. This paper focuses on recent progress in MREIT and discusses its distinct features in comparison with other imaging methods.},

The injected current should not produce any significant adverse effect especially on the nerve conduction system of the heart and still distinguish a small cancerous anomaly inside the breast. In this paper, we present results of experimental and numerical simulation studies of breast MREIT. From breast phantom experiments, we evaluated practical amounts of noise in measured magnetic flux density data. We built a realistic three-dimensional model of the human breast connected to a simplified model of the chest including the heart. We performed numerical simulations of various scenarios in breast MREIT including different amplitudes of injected currents and predicted SNRs of MR images related with imaging parameters. Simulation results are promising to show that we may detect a cancerous anomaly in the breast while restricting the maximal current density inside the heart below a level of nerve excitation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, the monitoring of cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) is mainly performed using invasive techniques. Therefore, performing CO monitoring noninvasively by means of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) would be advantageous for intensive care. Our hypothesis was that, by means of EIT, it is possible to assess heart rate (HR) and to quantify changes in SV due to changes in ventilator settings.

METHODS: CO (HR and SV) of 14 pigs (32-40 kg body weight) was changed by incremental increases in positive end-expiratory pressure levels (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm·H2O; ramp maneuver). This ramp maneuver was applied 4 times in each animal, yielding 43 evaluable single experiments. At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, SV was assessed by transpulmonary thermodilution using a PiCCO device. EIT data were acquired using a Dr\"{a}ger EIT Evaluation Kit 2.

RESULTS: The EIT-based SV-related signal, Z(SV) (in [AU]), showed only a weak correlation (after excluding 2 measurements) with SV(TTD) of r = 0.58 (95\% confidence interval, 0.43-0.71). If Z(SV) is calibrated by the reference 1 time for each experiment (defined as SVEIT), the correlation is approximately 0.85 (95\% confidence interval, 0.78-0.90). A possible reason for the moderate correlation is the unexpected scaling pattern, leading to amplification of the cardiac impedance signal, found in some animals. The scaling is probably due to the imperfect reconstruction (i.e., a change of sensitivity) of the EIT images or to a change in the position of the heart.

CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that EIT can be used to monitor CO and SV was confirmed, but further studies are required before this technique can be applied in clinical practice. HR was determined robustly and accurately. For SV monitoring, promising results were obtained in 80\% of the experiments. However, unexpected scaling of the cardiac EIT signal causing inaccurate estimation of SV remains an issue. Before robust assessment of SV by EIT is suitable for clinical practice, the cause of and compensation for undesired scaling effects need to be investigated.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Lung-protective ventilation aims at using low tidal volumes (VT) at optimum positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP). Optimum PEEP should recruit atelectatic lung regions and avoid tidal recruitment and end-inspiratory overinflation. We examined the effect of VT and PEEP on ventilation distribution, regional respiratory system compliance (C(RS)), and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) in an animal model of acute lung injury (ALI) and patients with ARDS by using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) with the aim to assess tidal recruitment and overinflation.

METHODS: EIT examinations were performed in 10 anaesthetized pigs with normal lungs ventilated at 5 and 10 ml/kg body weight VT and 5 cmH2O PEEP. After ALI induction, 10 ml/kg VT and 10 cmH2O PEEP were applied. Afterwards, PEEP was set according to the pressure-volume curve. Animals were randomized to either low or high VT ventilation changed after 30 minutes in a crossover design. Ventilation distribution, regional C(RS) and changes in EELV were analyzed. The same measures were determined in five ARDS patients examined during low and high VT ventilation (6 and 10 (8) ml/kg) at three PEEP levels.

RESULTS: In healthy animals, high compared to low VT increased C(RS) and ventilation in dependent lung regions implying tidal recruitment. ALI reduced C(RS) and EELV in all regions without changing ventilation distribution. Pressure-volume curve-derived PEEP of 21±4 cmH2O (mean±SD) resulted in comparable increase in C(RS) in dependent and decrease in non-dependent regions at both VT. This implied that tidal recruitment was avoided but end-inspiratory overinflation was present irrespective of VT. In patients, regional C(RS) differences between low and high VT revealed high degree of tidal recruitment and low overinflation at 3±1 cmH2O PEEP. Tidal recruitment decreased at 10±1 cmH2O and was further reduced at 15±2 cmH(2)O PEEP.

CONCLUSIONS: Tidal recruitment and end-inspiratory overinflation can be assessed by EIT-based analysis of regional C(RS).},

abstract = {Fluorescence imaging in diffusive media is an emerging imaging modality for medical applications that uses injected fluorescent markers that bind to specific targets, e.g., carcinoma. The region of interest is illuminated with near-IR light and the emitted back fluorescence is analyzed to localize the fluorescence sources. To investigate a thick medium, as the fluorescence signal decreases with the light travel distance, any disturbing signal, such as biological tissues intrinsic fluorescence (called autofluorescence) is a limiting factor. Several specific markers may also be simultaneously injected to bind to different molecules, and one may want to isolate each specific fluorescent signal from the others. To remove the unwanted fluorescence contributions or separate different specific markers, a spectroscopic approach is explored. The nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the blind positive source separation method we chose. We run an original regularized NMF algorithm we developed on experimental data, and successfully obtain separated in vivo fluorescence spectra.},

It is assumed that a major part of the current flowing through the object is restricted to the measurement plane (i.e. the plane determined by the electrodes which are used for measuring voltage differences) and the current flowing elsewhere is negligible. However, there is usually a three-dimensional (3D) variation of the conductivity distribution and if there are regions of high contrast close to the measurement plane, the measured voltage values may be considerably affected. In this work a 3D finite element analysis is utilised to demonstrate the previously mentioned effects.

abstract = {Image reconstruction in electrical impedance tomography is an ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. Linearization techniques are widely used and require the repeated solution of a linear forward problem. To account correctly for the presence of electrodes and contact impedances, the so-called complete electrode model is applied. Implementing a standard finite element method for this particular forward problem yields a linear system that is symmetric and positive definite and solvable via the conjugate gradient method. However, preconditioners are essential for efficient convergence. Preconditioners based on incomplete factorization methods are commonly used but their performance depends on user-tuned parameters. To avoid this deficiency, we apply black-box algebraic multigrid, using standard commercial and freely available software. The suggested solution scheme dramatically reduces the time cost of solving the forward problem. Numerical results are presented using an anatomically detailed model of the human head.},

abstract = {Recent PET imaging data from bronchoconstricted sheep (Vidal Melo et al., 2005) showed that V /Q distributions were bimodal and topographically patchy, but including a substantial heterogeneity at scales <2.2 ml. In this paper, we reanalyze the experimental data to establish the contribution of ventilation (V (r)) heterogeneity to the bimodality in V /Q . This analysis demonstrates that the distribution of V (r) during bronchoconstriction was bimodal with large patches of severe hypoventilation occupying an average of 41\% of the imaged lung. The degree of hypoventilation to these regions was highly correlated with the degree of oxygenation impairment, but was quite variable amongst animals in spite of consistent degrees of mechanical obstruction. Remarkably, those regions were found to be hyperventilated before methacholine and their degree of hyperventilation was correlated with their degree of hypoventilation during bronchoconstriction. These data suggest that improving the uniformity of ventilation at baseline may be a desirable therapeutic target if the risk of severe hypoxemia during asthma attacks is to be minimized and/or the distribution of inhaled pharmaceuticals is to be optimized.},

abstract = {Global pressure-volume (PV) curves are an adjunct measure to describe lung characteristics in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is convincing evidence that high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) cause barotrauma, while optimized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) helps avoid mechanical injury to the lungs by preventing repeated alveolar opening and closing. The optimal values of PIP and PEEP are deduced from the shape of the PV curve by the identification of so-called lower and upper inflection points. However, it has been demonstrated using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) that the inflection points vary across the lung. This study employs a simple curve-fitting technique to automatically define inflection points on both pressure-volume (PV) and pressure-impedance (PI) curves to asses the differences between global PV and regional PI estimates in animals before and after induced lung injury. The results demonstrate a clear increase in lower inflection point (LIP) along the gravitational axis both before and after lung injury. Moreover, it is clear from comparison of the local EIT-derived LIPs with those derived from global PV curves that a ventilation strategy based on the PV curve alone may leave dependent areas of the lung collapsed. EIT-based PI curve analysis may help choosing an optimal ventilation strategy.},

Two main technical difficulties of EIT are its low spatial resolution and sensitivity to measurement errors. Image reconstruction using l(1) norms allows addressing both difficulties, in comparison to traditional reconstruction using l(2) norms. A l(1) norm on the data residue term reduces the sensitivity to measurement errors, while the l(1) norm on the image prior reduces edge blurring. This paper proposes and tests a general lagged diffusivity type iterative method for EIT reconstructions l(1) and l(2) minimizations can be flexibly chosen on the data residue and/or image prior parts. Results show the flexibility of the algorithm and the merits of the l(1) solution.},

abstract = {Fluorescence represents a promising alternative technology to electrochemistry and spectroscopy for accurate analysis of glucose in diabetes; however, no implanted fluorescence glucose assay is currently commercially available. The method depends on the principle of fluorescence, which is the emission of light by a substance after absorbing light. A fluorophore is a molecule that will absorb energy of a specific wavelength and reemit energy at a different wavelength. A fluorescence glucose-sensing molecule can be constructed to increase or decrease in fluorescence from baseline according to the ambient concentration of glucose. A quantum dot is a semiconductor crystal that can serve as a sensor by fluorescing at a desired wavelength or color, depending on the crystal size and materials used. If receptor molecules for glucose can be adsorbed to single-wall carbon nanotubules, then the resulting binding of glucose to these receptors will alter the nanotubes' fluorescence. Fluorescence glucose sensors can provide a continuous glucose reading by being embedded into removable wire-shaped subcutaneous or intravenous catheters as well as other types of implanted structures, such as capsules, microcapsules, microbeads, nano-optodes, or capillary tubes. Fluorescence glucose-sensing methods, which are under development, offer four potential advantages over commercially used continuous glucose monitoring technologies: (1) greater sensitivity to low concentrations of glucose, (2) the possibility of constructing sensors that operate most accurately in the hypoglycemic range by using binding proteins with disassociation constants in this range, (3) less need to recalibrate in response to local tissue reactions around the sensor, and (4) no need to implant either a transmitter or a power source for wireless communication of glucose data. Fluorescence glucose sensors also have four significant disadvantages compared with commercially used continuous glucose monitoring technologies: (1) a damaging foreign body response; (2) a sensitivity to local pH and/or oxygen, which can affect the dye response; (3) potential toxicity of implanted dyes, especially if the implanted fluorophore cannot be fully removed; and (4) the necessity of always carrying a dedicated light source to interrogate the implanted sensor. Fluorescence sensing is a promising method for measuring glucose continuously, especially in the hypoglycemic range. If currently vexing technical and engineering and biocompatibility problems can be overcome, then this approach could lead to a new family of continuous glucose monitors.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a lowcost, non-invasive and radiation free medical imaging modality for monitoring ventilation distribution in the lung. Although such information could be invaluable in preventing ventilatorinduced lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients, clinical application of EIT is hindered by difficulties in interpreting the resulting images. One source of this difficulty is the frequent use of simple shapes which do not correspond to the anatomy to reconstruct EIT images. The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we therefore seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular EIT reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of 4 EIT reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch. Results suggest that while slight shape mismatch is well tolerated by all algorithms, using a circular shape severely degrades their performance.},

abstract = {Healthcare-associated infections (HCAI/HAI) represent a substantial threat to patient health during hospitalization and incur billions of dollars additional cost for subsequent treatment. One promising method for the detection of bacterial contamination in a clinical setting before an HAI outbreak occurs is to exploit native fluorescence of cellular molecules for a hand-held, rapid-sweep surveillance instrument. Previous studies have shown fluorescence-based detection to be sensitive and effective for food-borne and environmental microorganisms, and even to be able to distinguish between cell types, but this powerful technique has not yet been deployed on the macroscale for the primary surveillance of contamination in healthcare facilities to prevent HAI. Here we report experimental data for the specification and design of such a fluorescence-based detection instrument. We have characterized the complete fluorescence response of eleven clinically-relevant bacteria by generating excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) over broad wavelength ranges. Furthermore, a number of surfaces and items of equipment commonly present on a ward, and potentially responsible for pathogen transfer, have been analyzed for potential issues of background fluorescence masking the signal from contaminant bacteria. These include bedside handrails, nurse call button, blood pressure cuff and ward computer keyboard, as well as disinfectant cleaning products and microfiber cloth. All examined bacterial strains exhibited a distinctive double-peak fluorescence feature associated with tryptophan with no other cellular fluorophore detected. Thus, this fluorescence survey found that an emission peak of 340nm, from an excitation source at 280nm, was the cellular fluorescence signal to target for detection of bacterial contamination. The majority of materials analysed offer a spectral window through which bacterial contamination could indeed be detected. A few instances were found of potential problems of background fluorescence masking that of bacteria, but in the case of the microfiber cleaning cloth, imaging techniques could morphologically distinguish between stray strands and bacterial contamination.},

abstract = {In electrical impedance tomography, many factors affect the image reconstruction results. Among them are the number of electrodes (NOE) and the number of conductivity basis functions (NOCBF) for image reconstruction. The NOCBF generally reflects the density of the mesh with which images are reconstructed. How and to what extent do these factors affect the image reconstruction and corresponding images? In this area detailed analysis is still lacking. This study aims to address the above question. In this study, image reconstruction and its ill-posed condition were analysed by singular value decomposition (SVD) and spectral expansion theory with different configurations of NOE and NOCBF. The results in this study indicate that for a circular 2D plane object with electrodes evenly located around the boundary: (1) Under certain conditions, increasing the NOE enables us to improve the ill-posed condition in image reconstruction and hence improve the image quality. Generally more improvement is expected near the image periphery than in the image centre. (2) Increasing the NOCBF generally worsens the ill-posed condition. But it enables the solution to be sought in a finer subspace and may be able to improve the image quality on the periphery, while generally the result in image centre depends more on the prior information incorporated in the regularization.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) solves an inverse problem to estimate the conductivity distribution within a body from electrical simulation and measurements at the body surface, where the inverse problem is based on a solution of Laplace's equation in the body. Most commonly, a finite element model (FEM) is used, largely because of its ability to describe irregular body shapes. In this paper, we show that simulated variations in the positions of internal nodes within a FEM can result in serious image artefacts in the reconstructed images. Such variations occur when designing FEM meshes to conform to conductivity targets, but the effects may also be seen in other applications of absolute and difference EIT. We explore the hypothesis that these artefacts result from changes in the projection of the anisotropic conductivity tensor onto the FEM system matrix, which introduces anisotropic components into the simulated voltages, which cannot be reconstructed onto an isotropic image, and appear as artefacts. The magnitude of the anisotropic effect is analysed for a small regular FEM, and shown to be proportional to the relative node movement as a fraction of element size. In order to address this problem, we show that it is possible to incorporate a FEM node movement component into the formulation of the inverse problem. These results suggest that it is important to consider artefacts due to FEM mesh geometry in EIT image reconstruction.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) uses surface electrical measurements to image changes in the conductivity distribution within a medium. When used to measure lung ventilation, however, measurements depend both on conductivity changes in the thorax and on rib cage movement. Given that currently available reconstruction techniques assume that only conductivity changes are present, certain errors are introduced. A finite element model (FEM) is used to calculate the effect of chest expansion on the reconstructed conductivity images. Results indicate that thorax expansion accounts for up to 20\% of the reconstructed image amplitude and introduces an artifact in the center of the image tending to "move" the reconstructed lungs closer together. Although this contribution varies depending on anatomical factors, it is relatively independent of inspiration depth. For certain applications in which one is only interested in changes in the level of physiological activity, the effect of the expansion can be neglected because it varies linearly with impedance changes. We conclude that chest expansion can contribute significantly to the conductivity images of lung ventilation and should be taken into account in the interpretation of these images.},

abstract = {Right heart catheterization (RHC) is commonly used in the diagnosis and management of acute lung injury (ALI). However, controversy exists regarding RHC. We examined RHC use during the first 3 d of ALI in an observational study of 135 patients defined by American-European Consensus Conference criteria. Study parameters examined for association with RHC included the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III score, lung injury score (LIS), and 20 additional epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. RHC was performed in 70 patients (52\%) within the first 3 d of ALI. RHC was positively associated (p < 0.05) with a diagnosis of sepsis, APACHE III score, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, net fluid balance, and positive end-expiratory pressure. RHC was negatively associated (p < 0.05) with mean arterial pressure (Pa) and PaO2/FIO2. Logistic regression identified four predictors for RHC placement: sepsis, PaO2/FIO2, BUN, and Pa. Initial right atrial and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure measurements demonstrated a moderately strong correlation (r = 0.72). Use of RHC was associated with a change in one or more therapeutic interventions (intravascular fluids, vasopressors, diuretics) in 78\% of patients. In summary, patients receiving RHC during the first 3 d of ALI were more severely ill than those who did not receive RHC, and RHC was associated with a change in therapy in most patients.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an attractive method for clinically monitoring patients during mechanical ventilation, because it can provide a non-invasive continuous image of pulmonary impedance which indicates the distribution of ventilation. However, most clinical and physiological research in lung EIT is done using older and proprietary algorithms; this is an obstacle to interpretation of EIT images because the reconstructed images are not well characterized. To address this issue, we develop a consensus linear reconstruction algorithm for lung EIT, called GREIT (Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT). This paper describes the unified approach to linear image reconstruction developed for GREIT. The framework for the linear reconstruction algorithm consists of (1) detailed finite element models of a representative adult and neonatal thorax, (2) consensus on the performance figures of merit for EIT image reconstruction and (3) a systematic approach to optimize a linear reconstruction matrix to desired performance measures. Consensus figures of merit, in order of importance, are (a) uniform amplitude response, (b) small and uniform position error, (c) small ringing artefacts, (d) uniform resolution, (e) limited shape deformation and (f) high resolution. Such figures of merit must be attained while maintaining small noise amplification and small sensitivity to electrode and boundary movement. This approach represents the consensus of a large and representative group of experts in EIT algorithm design and clinical applications for pulmonary monitoring. All software and data to implement and test the algorithm have been made available under an open source license which allows free research and commercial use.},

abstract = {There has been a surge of interest in using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for monitoring regional lung ventilation, however, EIT is an ill-conditioned problem, and errors/noise in the boundary voltages can have an undesirable effect on the quality of the final image. Most EIT systems in clinical usage use serial data collection hence data used to create a single image will have been collected at different times. This paper presents a study of the resulting image distortion, and proposes a method for correcting this lag in situations where the frame rate is insufficient to prevent significant image degradation. Significant correlation between the standard deviation of the time dependent reciprocity error and time delay dLe between the reciprocal electrode combinations was found for both adult and neonate data. This was reduced when the data was corrected for dLe. Original and corrected data was reconstructed with the GREIT algorithm and visible differences were found for the neonate data. Ideally EIT systems should be run at a frame rate of at least 50 times the frequency of the dominant and interesting physiological signals. Where this is not practical, the intra-frame system timings should be determined and lag corrected for.},

Using EIT reconstruction based on anatomical models, candidate regions are identified in the frequency domain and image-based classification techniques applied. The algorithm was validated on a set of simultaneously recorded EIT and CT data in pigs. In all cases, identified regions in EIT images corresponded to those manually segmented in the matched CT image.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Positive-pressure ventilation causes a ventral redistribution of ventilation. Spontaneous breathing during general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway could prevent this redistribution of ventilation. We hypothesize that, compared with pressure-controlled ventilation, spontaneous breathing and pressure support ventilation reduce the extent of the redistribution of ventilation as detected by electrical impedance tomography. METHODS: The study was a randomized, three-armed, observational, clinical trial without blinding. With approval from the local ethics committee, we enrolled 30 nonobese patients without severe cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities who were scheduled for elective orthopedic surgery. All of the procedures were performed under general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway and a standardized anesthetic regimen. The center of ventilation (primary outcome) was calculated before the induction of anesthesia (AWAKE), after the placement of the laryngeal mask airway (BEGIN), before the end of anesthesia (END), and after arrival in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). RESULTS: The center of ventilation during anesthesia (BEGIN) was higher than baseline (AWAKE) in both the pressure-controlled and pressure support ventilation groups (pressure control: 55.0 vs. 48.3, pressure support: 54.7 vs. 48.8, respectively; multivariate analysis of covariance, P < 0.01), whereas the values in the spontaneous breathing group remained at baseline levels (47.9 vs. 48.5). In the postanesthesia care unit, the center of ventilation had returned to the baseline values in all groups. No adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Both pressure-controlled ventilation and pressure support ventilation induce a redistribution of ventilation toward the ventral region, as detected by electrical impedance tomography. Spontaneous breathing prevents this redistribution.},

abstract = {Completely or partially disconnected electrodes are a fairly common occurrence in many electrical impedance tomography (EIT) clinical applications. Several factors can contribute to electrode disconnection: patient movement, perspiration, manipulations by clinical staff, and defective electrode leads or electronics. By corrupting several measurements, faulty electrodes introduce significant image artifacts. In order to properly manage faulty electrodes, it is necessary to: 1) account for invalid data in image reconstruction algorithms and 2) automatically detect faulty electrodes. This paper presents a two-part approach for real-time management of faulty electrodes based on the principle of voltage-current reciprocity. The first part allows accounting for faulty electrodes in EIT image reconstruction without a priori knowledge of which electrodes are at fault. The method properly weights each measurement according to its compliance with the principle of voltage-current reciprocity. Results show that the algorithm is able to automatically determine the valid portion of the data and use it to calculate high-quality images. The second part of the approach allows automatic real-time detection of at least one faulty electrode with 100\% sensitivity and two faulty electrodes with 80\% sensitivity enabling the clinical staff to fix the problem as soon as possible to minimize data loss.},

@article{Pikkemaat2014a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:: Currently, the monitoring of cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) is mainly performed using invasive techniques. Therefore, performing CO monitoring noninvasively by means of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) would be advantageous for intensive care. Our hypothesis was that, by means of EIT, it is possible to assess heart rate (HR) and to quantify changes in SV due to changes in ventilator settings.

METHODS:: CO (HR and SV) of 14 pigs (32-40 kg body weight) was changed by incremental increases in positive end-expiratory pressure levels (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm·H2O; ramp maneuver). This ramp maneuver was applied 4 times in each animal, yielding 43 evaluable single experiments. At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, SV was assessed by transpulmonary thermodilution using a PiCCO device. EIT data were acquired using a Dr\"{a}ger EIT Evaluation Kit 2.

RESULTS:: The EIT-based SV-related signal, ZSV (in [AU]), showed only a weak correlation (after excluding 2 measurements) with SVTTD of r = 0.58 (95\% confidence interval, 0.43-0.71). If ZSV is calibrated by the reference 1 time for each experiment (defined as SVEIT), the correlation is approximately 0.85 (95\% confidence interval, 0.78-0.90). A possible reason for the moderate correlation is the unexpected scaling pattern, leading to amplification of the cardiac impedance signal, found in some animals. The scaling is probably due to the imperfect reconstruction (i.e., a change of sensitivity) of the EIT images or to a change in the position of the heart.

CONCLUSIONS:: The hypothesis that EIT can be used to monitor CO and SV was confirmed, but further studies are required before this technique can be applied in clinical practice. HR was determined robustly and accurately. For SV monitoring, promising results were obtained in 80\% of the experiments. However, unexpected scaling of the cardiac EIT signal causing inaccurate estimation of SV remains an issue. Before robust assessment of SV by EIT is suitable for clinical practice, the cause of and compensation for undesired scaling effects need to be investigated.},

@article{Borsic2002,
abstract = {In the inverse conductivity problem, as in any ill-posed inverse problem, regularization techniques are necessary in order to stabilize inversion. A common way to implement regularization in electrical impedance tomography is to use Tikhonov regularization. The inverse problem is formulated as a minimization of two terms: the mismatch of the measurements against the model, and the regularization functional. Most commonly, differential operators are used as regularization functionals, leading to smooth solutions. Whenever the imaged region presents discontinuities in the conductivity distribution, such as interorgan boundaries, the smoothness prior is not consistent with the actual situation. In these cases, the reconstruction is enhanced by relaxing the smoothness constraints in the direction normal to the discontinuity. In this paper, we derive a method for generating Gaussian anisotropic regularization filters. The filters are generated on the basis of the prior structural information, allowing a better reconstruction of conductivity profiles matching these priors. When incorporating prior information into a reconstruction algorithm, the risk is of biasing the inverse solutions toward the assumed distributions. Simulations show that, with a careful selection of the regularization parameters, the reconstruction algorithm is still able to detect conductivities patterns that violate the prior information. A generalized singular-value decomposition analysis of the effects of the anisotropic filters on regularization is presented in the last sections of the paper.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive technique providing cross-sectional images of the thorax. We have tested an extended evaluation procedure, the functional EIT (f-EIT), to identify the local shifts of ventilation known to occur during the transition between spontaneous, controlled and assisted ventilation modes. METHODS: Ten patients scheduled for elective laparotomy were studied in the surgical ward, operating theatre and ICU during spontaneous and different modes of mechanical ventilation. Sixteen ECG electrodes were placed on the circumference of the thorax and connected with an EIT device (APT System Mark I, IBEES, Sheffield, UK). Measurements lasting 180 s were performed and f-EIT images of regional ventilation computed. The geometrical centre of ventilation was determined to quantify the regional distribution of lung ventilation during individual modes of ventilation. RESULTS: F-EIT confirmed the differences in the distribution of ventilation associated with various modes of artificial ventilation. Accentuated ventilation of the dependent lung regions was observed during spontaneous breathing, whereas a shift of the centre of ventilation to the nondependent regions was found during controlled ventilation. In the course of assisted ventilation a continuous displacement of the centre of ventilation back towards the dependent lung regions, consistent with an increased proportion of spontaneous breathing, was detected. Unassisted spontaneous breathing after weaning from mechanical ventilation resulted in a similar ventilation distribution as during tidal breathing prior to surgery. CONCLUSION: F-EIT determined the redistribution of lung ventilation during different modes of mechanical ventilation. We expect that f-EIT will become a useful noninvasive bedside monitoring technique for imaging regional ventilation in pulmonary diseased patients during mechanical ventilation.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an imaging technique that has the potential to be used for studying neonate lung function. The properties of the electrodes are very important in multi-frequency EIT (MFEIT) systems, particularly for neonates, as the skin cannot be abraded to reduce contact impedance. In this work, the impedance of various clinical electrodes as a function of frequency is investigated to identify the optimum electrode type for this application. Six different types of self-adhesive electrodes commonly used in general and neonatal cardiology have been investigated. These electrodes are Ag/AgCl electrodes from the Ambu Cardiology Blue sensors range (BR, NF and BRS), Kendall (KittyCat and ARBO) and Philips 13953D electrodes. In addition, a textile electrode without gel from Textronics was tested on two subjects to allow comparison with the hydrogel-based electrodes. Two- and four-electrode measurements were made to determine the electrode-interface and tissue impedances, respectively. The measurements were made on the back of the forearm of six healthy adult volunteers without skin preparation with 2.5 cm electrode spacing. Impedance measurements were carried out using a Solartron SI 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyser with a frequency range from 10 Hz to 1 MHz. For the electrode-interface impedance, the average magnitude decreased with frequency, with an average value of 5 kOmega at 10 kHz and 337 Omega at 1 MHz; for the tissue impedance, the respective values were 987 Omega and 29 Omega. Overall, the Ambu BRS, Kendall ARBO and Textronics textile electrodes gave the lowest electrode contact impedance at 1 MHz. Based on the results of the two-electrode measurements, simple RC models for the Ambu BRS and Kendall-ARBO and Textronics textile electrodes have been derived for MFEIT applications.},

abstract = {Using positron emission tomography (PET) and intravenously injected (13)N(2), we assessed the topographical distribution of pulmonary perfusion (Q) and ventilation (V) in six healthy, spontaneously breathing subjects in the supine and prone position. In this technique, the intrapulmonary distribution of (13)N(2), measured during a short apnea, is proportional to regional Q. After resumption of breathing, regional specific alveolar V (sVA, ventilation per unit of alveolar gas volume) can be calculated from the tracer washout rate. The PET scanner imaged 15 contiguous, 6-mm-thick, slices of lung. Vertical gradients of Q and sVA were computed by linear regression, and spatial heterogeneity was assessed from the squared coefficient of variation (CV(2)). Both CV and CV were corrected for the estimated contribution of random imaging noise. We found that 1) both Q and V had vertical gradients favoring dependent lung regions, 2) vertical gradients were similar in the supine and prone position and explained, on average, 24\% of Q heterogeneity and 8\% of V heterogeneity, 3) CV was similar in the supine and prone position, and 4) CV was lower in the prone position. We conclude that, in recumbent, spontaneously breathing humans, 1) vertical gradients favoring dependent lung regions explain a significant fraction of heterogeneity, especially of Q, and 2) although Q does not seem to be systematically more homogeneous in the prone position, differences in individual behaviors may make the prone position advantageous, in terms of V-to-Q matching, in selected subjects.},

abstract = {In our group at University College London, we have been developing electrical impedance tomography (EIT) of brain function. We have attempted to improve image quality by the use of realistic anatomical meshes and, more recently, non-linear reconstruction methods. Reconstruction with linear methods, with pre-processing, may take up to a few minutes per image for even detailed meshes. However, iterative non-linear reconstruction methods require much more computational resources, and reconstruction with detailed meshes was taking far too long for clinical use. We present a solution to this timing bottleneck, using the resources of the GRID, the development of coordinated computing resources over the internet that are not subject to centralized control using standard, open, general-purpose protocols and are transparent to the user. Optimization was performed by splitting reconstruction of image series into individual jobs of one image each; no parallelization was attempted. Using the GRID middleware 'Condor' and a cluster of 920 nodes, reconstruction of EIT images of the human head with a non-linear algorithm was speeded up by 25-40 times compared to serial processing of each image. This distributed method is of direct practical value in applications such as EIT of epileptic seizures where hundreds of images are collected over the few minutes of a seizure and will be of value to clinical data collection with similar requirements. In the future, the same resources could be employed for the more ambitious task of parallelized code.},

abstract = {In electrical impedance tomography, currents are applied to the body through electrodes that are attached to the surface and the corresponding surface voltages are measured. Based on these boundary measurements, the internal admittivity distribution of the body can be reconstructed. In order to improve the image quality it is necessary and useful to apply physiologically meaningful prior information into the image reconstruction. Such prior information usually can be obtained from other sources. For example, information on the object's boundary shape and internal structure can be obtained from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scan. However, this type of prior information may change from time to time and from person to person. As these changes are limited anatomically and physiologically, the prior information including the possible changes can be presented in a number of variational forms. The aim of this paper is to find which form of prior information is more compatible for a specific imaged object at the time of imaging. This paper proposes a new method for selecting the most appropriate form of prior information, through the procedure of iterative image reconstruction by using the information obtained from boundary measurements. The method is based on the principle that incompatible prior information causes errors which are able to affect the image reconstruction's convergence behavior. In this method, according to the various forms of prior information available, several image reconstruction configurations are designed. Then, through monitoring the convergence behavior in an iterative image reconstruction, the configuration with compatible prior information can be found among those different configurations. As an example, the prior information regarding the imaged object's boundary shape and internal structure was studied by computer simulation. Results were shown and discussed.},

abstract = {Until now, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has been used for cardiac imaging with the electrodes attached transversally at the level of the fourth intercostal space at the anterior side. However, the results obtained with this electrode configuration have been disappointing. The aim of the present study was to improve the measurement design of EIT for cardiac imaging. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were analysed in two healthy subjects to determine the optimum anatomical plane in which atria and ventricles are clearly visually separated. From these findings, we proposed a new oblique plane at the level of the ictus cordis anteriorly and 10 cm higher posteriorly. EIT pictures obtained in the oblique plane revealed a better visual separation between the ventricles and atria than with the electrodes attached in the transverse plane. Comparison between volume changes measured by means of MRI and impedance changes in different regions of interest measured with EIT were performed with the electrodes in the proposed oblique plane. Ventricular and atrial volume changes measured by MRI show the same pattern as do impedance changes measured by EIT. Furthermore, we assessed the reproducibility and validity of the oblique electrode configuration in ten healthy male volunteers during rest and during exercise compared with the currently used transverse electrode configuration. The reproducibility coefficient assessed from repeated measurements with the electrodes attached in the oblique plane was 0.98 at rest and 0.85 during exercise. For the transverse plane the reproducibility coefficient was 0.96 at rest and 0.66 during exercise. The well-known increase in stroke volume during exercise is 40\% in healthy subjects. The increase in impedance change during exercise compared with rest was (20 - 59\%) for the oblique plane and (13 - 140\%) for the transverse plane. From these results we infer that the stroke volume is assessed more accurately by using the oblique plane. From these findings, we conclude that the oblique plane improved the cardiac measurements, because (i) a better spatial separation of the heart compartments is obtained, (ii) the results are more reliable and (iii) measurements during exercise are more accurate with the electrodes attached in an oblique plane.},

abstract = {Imaging of acute stroke might be possible using multi-frequency electrical impedance tomography (MFEIT) but requires absolute or frequency difference imaging. Simple linear frequency difference reconstruction has been shown to be ineffective in imaging with a frequency-dependant background conductivity; this has been overcome with a weighted frequency difference approach with correction for the background but this has only been validated for a cylindrical and hemispherical tank. The feasibility of MFEIT for imaging of acute stroke in a realistic head geometry was examined by imaging a potato perturbation against a saline background and a carrot-saline frequency-dependant background conductivity, in a head-shaped tank with the UCLH Mk2.5 MFEIT system. Reconstruction was performed with time difference (TD), frequency difference (FD), FD adjacent (FDA), weighted FD (WFD) and weighted FDA (WFDA) linear algorithms. The perturbation in reconstructed images corresponded to the true position to <9.5\% of image diameter with an image SNR of >5.4 for all algorithms in saline but only for TD, WFDA and WFD in the carrot-saline background. No reliable imaging was possible with FD and FDA. This indicates that the WFD approach is also effective for a realistic head geometry and supports its use for human imaging in the future.},

It is based on the assumption that all valid measurements are related by the image reconstruction model, while the measurements from erroneous electrodes are unrelated. The method estimates the data at an electrode based on the measurements from all other electrodes, and compares it to the measurements. If these data match adequately, the set of electrodes does not contain an erroneous electrode. In order to detect an erroneous electrode amongst N electrodes, all sets of N-1 electrodes are tested, and the set with the best match between measurements and estimate is identified as the one which excludes the erroneous electrode. The method was tested on simulated and experimental data and showed consistent identification of erroneous electrodes with those made by experts.},

abstract = {A computer model of gas uptake from an area of nonventilated lung, such as a pulmonary lobe with an occluded bronchus or an alveolus with an occluded airway, is presented. Previous analyses have assumed that when an inert gas is present, equilibration of O2 and CO2 with mixed venous blood is sufficiently rapid to be treated as instantaneous. This is valid for insoluble gases such as N2 or He when the fractional concentration of inspired O2 (FIO2) is < or = 0.6 but is invalid for a relatively soluble gas such as N2O. When a mixture of O2 and an inert gas is breathed, the time for an area of unventilated lung to collapse depends on the solubility of the inert gas and FIO2. When the solubility is low (N2 or He), collapse takes longer than when 100\% O2 is breathed, and the lower the FIO2 the longer the time to collapse. When the gas is more soluble (N2O) and FIO2 is > 0.3, collapse is more rapid than when 100\% O2 is breathed.},

abstract = {Objective, non-invasive measures of lung maturity and development, oxygen requirements and lung function, suitable for use in small, unsedated infants, are urgently required to define the nature and severity of persisting lung disease, and to identify risk factors for developing chronic lung problems. Disorders of lung growth, maturation and control of breathing are among the most important problems faced by the neonatologists. At present, no system for continuous monitoring of neonate lung function to reduce the risk of chronic lung disease in infancy in intensive care units exists. We are in the process of developing a new integrated electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system based on wearable technology to integrate measures of the boundary diameter from the boundary form for neonates into the reconstruction algorithm. In principle, this approach could provide a reduction of image artefacts in the reconstructed image associated with incorrect boundary form assumptions. In this paper, we investigate the required accuracy of the boundary form that would be suitable to minimize artefacts in the reconstruction for neonate lung function. The number of data points needed to create the required boundary form is automatically determined using genetic algorithms. The approach presented in this paper is to assist quality of the reconstruction using different approximations to the ideal boundary form. We also investigate the use of a wavelet algebraic multi-grid (WAMG) preconditioner to reduce the reconstruction computation requirements. Results are presented that demonstrate a full 3D model is required to minimize artefact in the reconstructed image and the implementation of a WAMG for EIT.},

@phdthesis{Adler1995,
abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) uses electrical measurements at electrodes placed on the body surface to produce a cross-sectional image of conductivity changes within the body. A low frequency current is injected between pairs of electrodes while voltage measurements are made at all other electrode pairs. Images are reconstructed of the change in conductivity distribution between the acquisition of the two sets of measurements. This technique can potentially provide useful information for the investigation of pulmonary function as the clinical phenomena of interest (air movement, blood perfusion, and pathological air or fluid presence, for example) induce large conductivity changes. Reconstruction of images in EIT requires the solution of an ill-conditioned non-linear inverse problem on noisy data, typically requiring simplifying assumptions or regularization. Two reconstruction algorithms are proposed which take into account the geometry of the conductive medium and the noise level in the measured data, and allow fast (near real-time) image reconstruction. An algorithm based on artificial neural networks is used to calculate a linear approximation of the inverse problem directly from finite element simulations of the forward problem. Results show good reconstruction when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the measurements is similar to the SNR used during network calculation. Additionally, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach to image reconstruction is developed, based on a priori estimates of the measurement noise and the maximum image resolution available. This approach has the advantage of an intuitive interpretation of algorithm parameters as well as theoretical support. In order to compare these approaches to existing algorithms, figures of merit are developed to measure the reconstructed image resolution, the noise amplification of the image reconstruction, and the fidelity of positioning of a target in the image. Certain physiological realities complicate the interpretation of EIT images. In the case of imaging of pulmonary function, the movement of electrodes placed on the thorax due to rib cage expansion introduces artefacts into the images. A finite element model of the mechanical and electrical properties of the thorax is used to determine the effect of chest expansion on the reconstructed conductivity change images. Results indicate that thorax expansion accounts for up to 20 percent of the reconstructed image amplitude, although for applications which are only concerned with changes in the level of physiological activity, the effect of the expansion can be neglected as it varies linearly with the lung tidal volume. Finally, in order to experimentally validate EIT as a tool for the measurement of pulmonary function, a series of experiments on dogs were conducted to quantify the accuracy of measurement of lung ventilation and lung fluid instillation. Results indicate good linear correlation (r > .95) between image amplitude and the tidal volume or fluid quantity. The average EIT measurement error was 90 ml for ventilation and 10 ml for instillation. Additionally, images clearly show the lung region of the animal and indicate which lung underwent fluid instillation. These results demonstrate the potential of EIT as a tool for the investigation of pulmonary function.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive method to image conductivity distributions within a body. One promising application of EIT is to monitor ventilation in patients as a real-time bed-side tool. Thus it is essential that an EIT system reliably provide meaningful information, or alert clinicians when this is impossible. Because the reconstructed images are very sensitive to system instabilities (primarily from electrode connection variability and movement), EIT systems should continuously monitor and, if possible, correct for such errors. Motivated by this requirement, we describe a novel approach to quantitatively measure EIT data quality. Our goals are to: define the requirements of a data quality metric, develop a metric q which meets these requirements, and an efficient way to calculate it. The developed metric q was validated using data from saline tank experiments and a retrospective clinical study. Additionally, we show that q may be used to compare the performance of EIT systems using phantom measurements. Results suggest that the calculated metric reflects well the quality of reconstructed EIT images for both phantom and clinical data. The proposed measure can thus be used for real-time assessment of EIT data quality and, hence, to indicate the reliability of any derived physiological information.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has the potential to become a new tool for bedside monitoring of regional lung ventilation. The aim of our study was to assess the reproducibility of regional lung ventilation distribution determined by EIT during mechanical ventilation under identical ventilator settings. The experiments were performed on 10 anaesthetized supine pigs ventilated in a volume-controlled mode. EIT measurements were performed with the Goe-MF II device (Viasys Healthcare, H\"{o}chberg, Germany) during repeated changes in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 0 to 10 cm H2O. Regional lung ventilation was determined in the right and left hemithorax as well as in 64 regions of interest evenly distributed over each chest side in the ventrodorsal direction. Ventilation distributions in both lungs were visualized as ventrodorsal ventilation profiles and shifts in ventilation distribution quantified in terms of centres of ventilation in relation to the chest diameter. The proportion of the right lung on total ventilation in the chest cross-section was 0.54+/-0.04 and remained unaffected by repetitive PEEP changes. Initial PEEP increase resulted in a redistribution of ventilation towards dorsal lung regions with a shift of the centre of ventilation from 45+/-3\% to 49+/-3\% of the chest diameter in the right and from 47+/-2\% to 50+/-2\% in the left hemithorax. Excellent reproducibility of the results in the individual regions of interest with almost identical patterns of ventilation distribution was found during repeated PEEP changes.},

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age, diagnosis, endotracheal tube size, type of ventilator and humidification, duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation, ventilatory settings, and complications (accidental extubation, tissue damage, endobronchial intubation, postintubation stridor, endotracheal tube blockage, pulmonary airleak, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pulmonary atelectasis) were recorded. RESULTS: The median patient age was 10 months (25th and 75th quartiles: 1 month and 15 yrs). The median duration of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation was 4 days and 2 days, respectively. A total of 186 complications were recorded in 119 (24\%) patients. No deaths were due to intubation or ventilation. The overall frequency of accidental extubation was 3.2\% of patients at a rate of 1.26 extubations/100 intubation days. In nonventilated, unsedated patients with croup or epiglottitis, the frequency of accidental extubation was 23\% at a rate of 11.83 extubations/100 intubation days. Lung atelectasis occurred in 7.8\%, airleak in 6.8\%, and infection in 2.3\% of patients. Other complications included tissue damage (3.4\%), endobronchial intubation (2.4\%), postintubation stridor (2.4\%), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (2.3\%), and endobronchial tube blockage (0.8\%). CONCLUSIONS: Complications were related to the duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation.},

abstract = {A method to assess the three-dimensional distribution of alveolar ventilation-perfusion ratio (VA/Q) by imaging the lungs with positron emission tomography (PET) during a constant-rate intravenous infusion of 13NN-labeled saline solution was developed by C. G. Rhodes, S. O. Valind, L. H. Brudin, P. E. Wollmer, T. Jones, P. D. Buckingham, and J. M. B. Hughes (J. Appl. Physiol. 66: 1896-1904 and 1905-1913, 1989). We have modified this methodology to obtain high-resolution, low-noise PET images of local VA/Q where lung motion artifact was eliminated by respiratory gating of image collection. In addition, we have refined and implemented the methods to assess local alveolar ventilation by imaging the washout of equilibrated 13NN and local perfusion by imaging the distribution of an intravenous bolus of 13NN-labeled saline solution during apnea. This paper experimentally evaluates the effect of the implemented modifications in mechanically ventilated and anesthetized dogs. We found that the lack of gating had no significant effect on the average recovered VA/Q, but the spatial heterogeneity [pixel-by-pixel coefficient of variation squared (CV2) = SD2/mean2] was underestimated by 14\%. The lack of gating during the washout underestimated the average specific ventilation by 11\% and decreased the corresponding CV2 by 50\%.},

abstract = {Frequency-difference electrical impedance tomography (fdEIT) has been proposed to deal with technical difficulties of a conventional static EIT imaging method caused by unknown boundary geometry, uncertainty in electrode positions and other systematic measurement artifacts. In fdEIT, we try to produce images showing changes of a complex conductivity distribution with respect to frequency. Simultaneously injecting currents with at least two frequencies, we find differences of measured boundary voltages between those frequencies. In most previous studies, real parts of frequency-difference voltage data were used to reconstruct conductivity changes and imaginary parts to reconstruct permittivity changes. This conventional approach neglects the interplay of conductivity and permittivity upon measured boundary voltage data. In this paper, we propose an improved fdEIT image reconstruction algorithm that properly handles the interaction. It uses weighted frequency differences of complex voltage data and a complex sensitivity matrix to reconstruct frequency-difference images of complex conductivity distributions. We found that there are two major sources of image contrast in fdEIT. The first is a contrast in complex conductivity values between an anomaly and background. The second is a frequency dependence of a complex conductivity distribution to be imaged. We note that even for the case where conductivity and permittivity do not change with frequency, the fdEIT algorithm may show a contrast in frequency-difference images of complex conductivity distributions. On the other hand, even if conductivity and permittivity values significantly change with frequency, there is an example where we cannot find any contrast. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by using computer simulations to validate its feasibility in future experimental studies.},

abstract = {Purpose: To develop a multi-spectral method to measure oxygen saturation of the retina in the human eye. Methods: Five Cynomolgus monkeys with normal eyes were anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine/xylazine and intravenous pentobarbital. Multi-spectral fundus imaging was performed in five monkeys with a commercial fundus camera equipped with a liquid crystal tuned filter in the illumination light path and a 16-bit digital camera. Recording parameters were controlled with software written specifically for the application. Seven images at successively longer oxygen-sensing wavelengths were recorded within 4 seconds. Individual images for each wavelength were captured in less than 100 msec of flash illumination. Slightly misaligned images of separate wavelengths due to slight eye motion were registered and corrected by translational and rotational image registration prior to analysis. Numerical values of relative oxygen saturation of retinal arteries and veins and the underlying tissue in between the artery/vein pairs were evaluated by an algorithm previously described, but which is now corrected for blood volume from averaged pixels (n > 1000). Color saturation maps were constructed by applying the algorithm at each image pixel using a Matlab script. Results: Both the numerical values of relative oxygen saturation and the saturation maps correspond to the physiological condition, that is, in a normal retina, the artery is more saturated than the tissue and the tissue is more saturated than the vein. With the multi-spectral fundus camera and proper registration of the multi-wavelength images, we were able to determine oxygen saturation in the primate retinal structures on a tolerable time scale which is applicable to human subjects. Conclusions: Seven wavelength multi-spectral imagery can be used to measure oxygen saturation in retinal artery, vein, and tissue (microcirculation). This technique is safe and can be used to monitor oxygen uptake in humans. This work is original and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance-electrical impedance tomography (MR-EIT) is a conductivity imaging method based on injecting currents into the object. In this study, a new MR-EIT method, whereby currents are induced inside the object by using external coils, is proposed. This new method is called induced current magnetic resonance-electrical impedance tomography. In induced current MR-EIT surface electrodes are not used and thereby artifacts due to electrodes are eliminated. The reconstruction algorithm is based on the measurement of only one component of the secondary magnetic flux density. The algorithm is an iterative one, is 3D and is based on the solution of a linear matrix equation at each iteration. For the measurement of secondary magnetic flux density, a pulse sequence to be used in the MRI system is proposed. Numerical simulations are performed to test the algorithm for both noise-free and noisy cases. The singular value behavior of the matrix is monitored and it is observed that at least two current induction profiles improve the images significantly. It is shown that induced current MR-EIT can be used to reconstruct absolute conductivity images without the need for any additional peripheral voltage measurement.},

Generally, a real or complex conductivity is determined uniquely by complete boundary data. Uniqueness results are also known for planar resistor networks. However, it is common to make gross errors in the forward modeling of the electrical fields and this may result in no consistent solution. In particular, a two-dimensional model is often used when data are collected from a three-dimensional domain. The boundary shape is often inaccurately known, and commonly modeled by a circle. No model conductivity consistent with measured data exists when the dimension or the boundary shape is wrong.},

In extracted tumor tissues we measured a two-peaked emission in low grade gliomas and in the infiltrative component of glioblastomas due to multiple photochemical states of PpIX. The second emission peak appearing at 620 nm (shifted by 14 nm from the main peak at 634 nm) limits the sensibility of current methods to measured PpIX concentration. We propose new measured parameters, by taking into consideration the two-peaked emission, to overcome these limitations in sensitivity. These parameters clearly distinguish the solid component of glioblastomas from low grade gliomas and infiltrative component of glioblastomas.},

The aim of our study was to determine if EIT was able to assess spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ventilation during pulmonary function testing in 14 young (37 ± 10 yr, mean age ± SD) and 12 elderly (71 ± 9 yr) subjects without lung disease and in 33 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (71 ± 9 yr). EIT and spirometry examinations were performed during tidal breathing and a forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuver preceded by full inspiration to total lung capacity. Regional inspiratory vital capacity (IVC); FVC; forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)); FEV(1)/FVC; times required to expire 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 90\% of FVC (t(25), t(50), t(75), t(90)); and tidal volume (V(T)) were determined in 912 EIT image pixels in the chest cross section. Coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated from all pixel values of IVC, FVC, FEV(1), and V(T) to characterize the ventilation heterogeneity. The highest values were found in patients, and no differences existed between the healthy young and elderly subjects. Receiver-operating characteristics curves showed that CV of regional IVC, FVC, FEV(1), and V(T) discriminated the young and elderly subjects from the patients. Frequency distributions of pixel FEV(1)/FVC, t(25), t(50), t(75), and t(90) identified the highest ventilation heterogeneity in patients but distinguished also the healthy young from the elderly subjects. These results indicate that EIT may provide additional information during pulmonary function testing and identify pathologic and age-related spatial and temporal heterogeneity of regional lung function.},

This method is a safe, inexpensive and potentially fast technique for cardiac output imaging but the spatial resolution is presently low, particularly for central locations such as the heart. Many parameters including noise deteriorate the reconstruction result. One of the main obstacles in cardiac imaging at the heart location is the high impedance of lungs and muscles on the dorsal and posterior side of body. In this study we are investigating improvements of the measurement and initial conductivity estimation of the internal electrode by modelling an internal electrode inside the esophagus. We consider 16 electrodes connected around a cylindrical mesh. With the random noise level set near 0.05\% of the signal we evaluated the Graz consensus reconstruction algorithm for electrical impedance tomography. The modelling and simulation results showed that the quality of the target in reconstructed images was improved by up to 5 times for amplitude response, position error, resolution, shape deformation and ringing effects with perturbations located in cardiac related positions when using an internal electrode.},

In this paper, we present results of experimental and numerical simulation studies of breast MREIT. We built a realistic three-dimensional model of the human breast connected to a simplified model of the chest including the heart and evaluated the ability of MREIT to detect cancerous anomalies in a background material with similar electrical properties to breast tissue. We performed numerical simulations of various scenarios in breast MREIT including assessment of the effects of fat inclusions and effects related to noise levels, such as changing the amplitude of injected currents, effect of added noise and number of averages. Phantom results showed straightforward detection of cancerous anomalies in a background was possible with low currents and few averages. The simulation results showed it should be possible to detect a cancerous anomaly in the breast, while restricting the maximal current density in the heart below published levels for nerve excitation.},

abstract = {Most algorithms for magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) concentrate on reconstructing the internal conductivity distribution of a conductive object from the Laplacian of only one component of the magnetic flux density (∇²B(z)) generated by the internal current distribution. In this study, a new algorithm is proposed to solve this ∇²B(z)-based MREIT problem which is mathematically formulated as the steady-state scalar pure convection equation. Numerical methods developed for the solution of the more general convection-diffusion equation are utilized. It is known that the solution of the pure convection equation is numerically unstable if sharp variations of the field variable (in this case conductivity) exist or if there are inconsistent boundary conditions. Various stabilization techniques, based on introducing artificial diffusion, are developed to handle such cases and in this study the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization method is incorporated into the Galerkin weighted residual finite element method (FEM) to numerically solve the MREIT problem. The proposed algorithm is tested with simulated and also experimental data from phantoms. Successful conductivity reconstructions are obtained by solving the related convection equation using the Galerkin weighted residual FEM when there are no sharp variations in the actual conductivity distribution. However, when there is noise in the magnetic flux density data or when there are sharp variations in conductivity, it is found that SUPG stabilization is beneficial.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown the ability of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to assess regional ventilation distribution in human lungs. Fluid accumulation in the pleural space as in empyema, typically occurring on one chest side, may influence the distribution of ventilation and the corresponding EIT findings. The aim of our study was to examine this effect on the assessment of regional ventilation by EIT. Six patients suffering from unilateral empyema and intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube were studied. EIT data were acquired during volume-controlled ventilation with bilateral (tidal volume (VT): 800 ml) and unilateral ventilation (VT: 400 ml) of the right and left lungs. Mean tidal amplitudes of the EIT signal were calculated in all image pixels. The sums of these values, expressed as relative impedance change (rel. $\Delta$Z), were then determined in whole images and functionally defined regions-of-interest (ROI). The sums of rel. $\Delta$Z calculated during the two cases of one-lung ventilation either on the affected or unaffected side were significantly smaller than during bilateral ventilation. However, in contrast to previous findings in patients with no pleural pathology, very low values of rel. $\Delta$Z were found when the lung on the affected side was ventilated. ROI-based analysis rendered higher values than the whole-image analysis in this case, nonetheless, the values were significantly smaller than when the unaffected side was ventilated in spite of identical VT. In conclusion, our results indicate that the presence of empyema may affect the quantitative evaluation of regional lung ventilation by EIT.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Pneumothorax is a frequent complication during mechanical ventilation. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive tool that allows real-time imaging of regional ventilation. The purpose of this study was to 1) identify characteristic changes in the EIT signals associated with pneumothoraces; 2) develop and fine-tune an algorithm for their automatic detection; and 3) prospectively evaluate this algorithm for its sensitivity and specificity in detecting pneumothoraces in real time. DESIGN: Prospective controlled laboratory animal investigation. SETTING: Experimental Pulmonology Laboratory of the University of S\~{a}o Paulo. SUBJECTS: Thirty-nine anesthetized mechanically ventilated supine pigs (31.0 +/- 3.2 kg, mean +/- SD). INTERVENTIONS: In a first group of 18 animals monitored by EIT, we either injected progressive amounts of air (from 20 to 500 mL) through chest tubes or applied large positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) increments to simulate extreme lung overdistension. This first data set was used to calibrate an EIT-based pneumothorax detection algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluated the real-time performance of the detection algorithm in 21 additional animals (with normal or preinjured lungs), submitted to multiple ventilatory interventions or traumatic punctures of the lung. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary EIT relative images were acquired online (50 images/sec) and processed according to a few imaging-analysis routines running automatically and in parallel. Pneumothoraces as small as 20 mL could be detected with a sensitivity of 100\% and specificity 95\% and could be easily distinguished from parenchymal overdistension induced by PEEP or recruiting maneuvers. Their location was correctly identified in all cases, with a total delay of only three respiratory cycles. CONCLUSIONS: We created an EIT-based algorithm capable of detecting early signs of pneumothoraces in high-risk situations, which also identifies its location. It requires that the pneumothorax occurs or enlarges at least minimally during the monitoring period. Such detection was operator-free and in quasi real-time, opening opportunities for improving patient safety during mechanical ventilation.},

@article{Kitchen2014,
abstract = {Current recommendations suggest the use of positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) to assist very preterm infants to develop a functional residual capacity (FRC) and establish gas exchange at birth. However, maintaining a consistent PEEP is difficult and so the lungs are exposed to changing distending pressures after birth, which can affect respiratory function. Our aim was to determine how changing PEEP levels alters the distribution of ventilation within the lung. Preterm rabbit pups (28 days gestation) were delivered and mechanically ventilated with one of three strategies, whereby PEEP was changed in sequence; 0-5-10-5-0 cmH2O, 5-10-0-5-0 cmH2O or 10-5-0-10-0 cmH2O. Phase contrast X-ray imaging was used to analyse the distribution of ventilation in the upper left (UL), upper right (UR), lower left (LL) and lower right (LR) quadrants of the lung. Initiating ventilation with 10PEEP resulted in a uniform increase in FRC throughout the lung whereas initiating ventilation with 5PEEP or 0PEEP preferentially aerated the UR than both lower quadrants (p<0.05). Consequently, the relative distribution of incoming VT was preferentially directed into the lower lobes at low PEEP, primarily due to the loss of FRC in those lobes. Following ventilation at 10PEEP, the distribution of air at end-inflation was uniform across all quadrants and remained so regardless of the PEEP level. Uniform distribution of ventilation can be achieved by initiating ventilation with a high PEEP. After the lungs have aerated, small and stepped reductions in PEEP result in more uniform changes in ventilation.},

abstract = {A fully automated, intrinsic gating algorithm for small animal cone-beam CT is described and evaluated. A parameter representing the organ motion, derived from the raw projection images, is used for both cardiac and respiratory gating. The proposed algorithm makes it possible to reconstruct motion-corrected still images as well as to generate four-dimensional (4D) datasets representing the cardiac and pulmonary anatomy of free-breathing animals without the use of electrocardiogram (ECG) or respiratory sensors. Variation analysis of projections from several rotations is used to place a region of interest (ROI) on the diaphragm. The ROI is cranially extended to include the heart. The centre of mass (COM) variation within this ROI, the filtered frequency response and the local maxima are used to derive a binary motion-gating parameter for phase-sensitive gated reconstruction. This algorithm was implemented on a flat-panel-based cone-beam CT scanner and evaluated using a moving phantom and animal scans (seven rats and eight mice). Volumes were determined using a semiautomatic segmentation. In all cases robust gating signals could be obtained. The maximum volume error in phantom studies was less than 6\%. By utilizing extrinsic gating via externally placed cardiac and respiratory sensors, the functional parameters (e.g. cardiac ejection fraction) and image quality were equivalent to this current gold standard. This algorithm obviates the necessity of both gating hardware and user interaction. The simplicity of the proposed algorithm enables adoption in a wide range of small animal cone-beam CT scanners.},

@phdthesis{Graham2007,
abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an imaging technique which calculates the elec- trical conductivity distribution within a medium from electrical measurements made at a series of electrodes on the medium surface. Reconstruction of conductivity or conductivity change images requires the solution of an ill-conditioned nonlinear inverse problem from noisy data. EIT is a hard problem as it is a particularly difficult example of attempting to recover a signal from noise. To date most EIT scanners and algorithms have been designed for 2D applications. This simplifying assumption was originally used due to the prohibitive computational complexity of solving the larger 3D problem. Contemporary PC’s can now calculate 3D solutions, however at the start of this thesis the prevailing algorithms in clinical use remain 2D models that rely on ad hoc tweaking to produce useful reconstructions. The aim of this thesis is to develop enhancements in EIT image reconstruction for 3D lung imaging; to remove some of the limitations that continue to impede its routine use in the clinic. The aim is attained through the systematic achievement of the following four main objectives: (1) Improve the method of hyperparameter selection in order to eliminate case by case tweaking of parameters, provide repeatability of experiments, and reduce the number of reconstructions needed to find the best reconstruction for a given data set. (2) Increase the resolution of 3D models by increasing the number of elements in the Finite Element Model (FEM). This requires the development of an algorithm to solve the large inversion using readily available computers. (3) Determine the best way to collect 3D data from the chest given some equipment limitations and a specific set constraints concerning electrode placement. (4) Determine the viability of non-blurring regularization for 3D lung imaging. The bulk of this thesis describes how the four objectives were successfully addressed with the result that some of the major limitations discouraging and preventing the routine use of 3D models for lung imaging have been eliminated. This thesis concludes with a recommendation for how to collect and reconstruct 3D EIT images of the lungs.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To establish the value of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in assessing pulmonary edema in noncardiogenic acute respiratory failure (ARF), as compared to the thermal dye double indicator dilution technique (TDD).

DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.

SETTING: ICU of a general hospital.

PATIENTS: Fourteen ARF patients.

INTERVENTIONS: In order to use the TDD to determine the amount of extravascular lung water (EVLW), a fiberoptic catheter was placed in the femoral artery. Measurements and main results: Fourteen consecutive ARF patients receiving mechanical ventilation were measured by EIT and TDD. EIT visualizes the impedance changes caused by the ventilation in two-dimensional image planes. An impedance ratio (IR) of the ventilation-induced impedance changes of a posterior and an anterior part of the lungs was used to indicate the amount of EVLW. For the 29 measurements in 14 patients, a significant correlation between EIT and TDD (r = 0. 85; p < 0.001) was found. The EIT reproducibility was good. The diagnostic value of the method was tested by receiver operator characteristic analysis, with 10 mL/kg of EVLW considered as the upper limit of normal. At a cutoff level of the IR of 0.64, the IR had a sensitivity of 93\%, a specificity of 87\%, and a positive predictive value of 87\% for a supranormal amount of EVLW. Follow-up measurements were performed in 11 patients. A significant correlation was found between the changes in EVLW measured with EIT and TDD (r = 0.85; p < 0.005).

CONCLUSION: We conclude that EIT is a noninvasive technique for reasonably estimating the amount of EVLW in noncardiogenic ARF.},

abstract = {There has been a surge of interest in using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for monitoring regional lung ventilation, however, EIT is an ill-conditioned problem, and errors/noise in the boundary voltages can have an undesirable effect on the quality of the final image. Most EIT systems in clinical usage use serial data collection hence data used to create a single image will have been collected at different times. This paper presents a study of the resulting image distortion, and proposes a method for correcting this lag in situations where the frame rate is insufficient to prevent significant image degradation. Significant correlation between the standard deviation of the time dependent reciprocity error and time delay dLe between the reciprocal electrode combinations was found for both adult and neonate data. This was reduced when the data was corrected for dLe. Original and corrected data was reconstructed with the GREIT algorithm and visible differences were found for the neonate data. Ideally EIT systems should be run at a frame rate of at least 50 times the frequency of the dominant and interesting physiological signals. Where this is not practical, the intra-frame system timings should be determined and lag corrected for.},

As the patients cannot hold breath during the PET acquisition, spatial blurring and motion artifacts are the natural result. These may lead to wrong quantification of the radioactive uptake. We present a solution to this problem by respiratory-gating the PET data and correcting the PET images for motion with optical flow algorithms. The algorithm is based on the combined local and global optical flow algorithm with modifications to allow for discontinuity preservation across organ boundaries and for application to 3-D volume sets. The superiority of the algorithm over previous work is demonstrated on software phantom and real patient data.},

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Measurement of alveolar volume (Va) and regional ventilation (a) is crucial to understanding the pathophysiology of acute lung injury and ventilator-induced lung injury. PET has previously been used as a noninvasive, quantitative method to assess a, but formal validation of this technique in experimental lung injury is lacking. This study aims to validate Va and a regional assessment with PET, using inhaled (13)N-N(2) in pigs. METHODS: Two normal and 2 oleic acid-injured pigs were tracheotomized, mechanically ventilated, and studied in 5 different levels of ventilation by changing respiratory rate. In each experimental condition, lungs were washed-in and then washed-out with (13)N-N(2) through an open circuit in the ventilator. Using this method, multiframe images were acquired with a dedicated PET camera. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on each lung. Regional time-activity curves during washout were generated for each ROI and fitted to a mono- and a bicompartmental model. Validation of this method was performed in 2 ways. First, regional values of predicted Va (Va(emission)) were compared with regional volume obtained independently from density analysis on a transmission scan (Va(trans)). Second, regional values of predicted a were summed in each animal during each experimental condition and compared with minute-ventilation values set on the ventilator. RESULTS: The bicompartmental model best fitted the experimental values in normal (94.7\% [62.2\%-100.0\%] (median [interquartile range]) of the ROIs) as well as in injured animals (90.7\% [81.6\%-97.4\%] of the ROIs) (P = 0.49). Va(emission) significantly correlated with Va(trans) (R(2) = 0.89, P < 0.001) but exceeded Va(trans) by 10\%. Finally, a strongly and positively correlated with minute-ventilation in both normal (R(2) = 0.96, P < 0.001) and injured (R(2) = 0.96, P < 0.001) animals. CONCLUSION: Measurement of (13)N-N(2) washout using PET is accurate to assess regional alveolar volume and ventilation during experimental acute lung injury.},

abstract = {Applied potential tomography (APT) or electrical impedance imaging has received considerable attention during the past few years and some in vivo images have been produced. This paper reviews the current situation in terms of what in vivo results have been and are likely to be obtained in the near future. Both static and dynamic imaging are possible and these two areas are dealt with separately. Features of the existing in vivo imaging system are good tissue contrast, high-speed data collection, good sensitivity to resistivity changes, low spatial resolution, low cost and no known hazard. It is concluded that the most promising way forward to clinical application in the short term is to use dynamic as opposed to static imaging. An example of lung imaging is shown and the application to measuring regional ventilation and pulmonary oedema is discussed. Use of APT for the detection of intraventricular bleeding in neonates is discussed as is the proven ability to study gastric physiology by imaging resistivity distribution changes following the ingestion of conducting or insulating fluids. Other areas of possible application which are considered are blood flow measurement, cell counting, measurement of lean-fat ratios and the detection of soft tissue lesions.},

abstract = {Patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) are vulnerable to ventilator-induced lung injury. Although this syndrome affects the lung heterogeneously, mechanical ventilation is not guided by regional indicators of potential lung injury. We used electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to estimate the extent of regional lung overdistension and atelectasis during mechanical ventilation. Techniques for tidal breath detection, lung identification, and regional compliance estimation were combined with the Graz consensus on EIT lung imaging (GREIT) algorithm. Nine ALI/ARDS patients were monitored during stepwise increases and decreases in airway pressure. Our method detected individual breaths with 96.0\% sensitivity and 97.6\% specificity. The duration and volume of tidal breaths erred on average by 0.2 s and 5\%, respectively. Respiratory system compliance from EIT and ventilator measurements had a correlation coefficient of 0.80. Stepwise increases in pressure could reverse atelectasis in 17\% of the lung. At the highest pressures, 73\% of the lung became overdistended. During stepwise decreases in pressure, previously-atelectatic regions remained open at sub-baseline pressures. We recommend that the proposed approach be used in collaborative research of EIT-guided ventilation strategies for ALI/ARDS.},

abstract = {An algorithm is proposed for the spectral and colorimetric characterization of digital still cameras (DSC) which allows them to be used as tele-colorimeters with CIE-XYZ color output, in cd/m(2). The spectral characterization consists in the calculation of the color-matching functions from the previously measured spectral sensitivities. The colorimetric characterization consists in transforming the raw RGB digital data into absolute tristimulus values CIE-XYZ (in cd/m(2)) under variable and unknown spectroradiometric conditions. Thus, in the first stage, a gray balance was applied over the raw RGB digital data to convert them into RGB relative colorimetric values. In the second stage, an algorithm of luminance adaptation versus lens aperture was inserted in the basic colorimetric profile. Capturing the ColorChecker chart under different light sources, and comparing the estimated XYZ data according to the developed color model in relation to the measured XYZ data (in cd/m(2)) using a telespectroradiometer, we verified that the proposed characterization model may be broken down into two portions. Firstly, there is the basic colorimetric profile in combination with the new luminance adaptation algorithm. Secondly, there is the linear correction term due only to the mismatch of the color matching functions of the camera. Although the linear color correction term works relatively well, despite the imposed initial conditions (unknown spectral content of the scene), the separation of the proposed characterization model into two portions (raw and corrected performance) would allow the future comparison of various commercial cameras.},

abstract = {In medical diagnostics, tissue is often examined with multiple discrete biopsies taken under ultrasound placement. In a previous theoretical study, we have suggested that the linear nature of the equations used in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can be employed with the conventional practice of biopsy sampling to produce an image of the tissue between the biopsy samplings. Specifically, the biopsy probes can be used to record EIT-type electrical data during the discrete tissue sampling. The location of the discrete biopsy needle insertions available from the ultrasound placement of the probes can be combined with the electrical measurement data and used with linear superposition to produce a complete EIT image of the tissue between the sampled sites. In this study, we explore the concept experimentally using gel phantoms to simulate tissue and heterogeneities in the tissue. The experiments are performed in 2-D and 3-D configurations, and data are taken discretely, one at a time, through single electrical probe insertions. In the 2-D configuration, we were able to produce images of reasonable quality for heterogeneities with a diameter larger than 3 mm (conductivity ratio 1:5) and with relative conductivity differences above 50\% (diameter 5 mm).},

abstract = {Although electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for ventilation monitoring is on the verge of clinical trials, pulmonary perfusion imaging with EIT remains a challenge, especially in spontaneously breathing subjects. In anticipation of more research on this subject, we believe a thorough review is called for. In this paper, findings related to the physiological origins and electrical characteristics of this signal are summarized, highlighting properties that are particularly relevant to EIT. The perfusion impedance change signal is significantly smaller in amplitude compared with the changes due to ventilation. Therefore, the hardware used for this purpose must be more sensitive and more resilient to noise. In previous works, some signal- or image-processing methods have been required to separate these two signals. Three different techniques are reviewed in this paper, including the ECG-gating method, frequency-domain-filtering-based methods and a principal-component-analysis-based method. In addition, we review a number of experimental studies on both human and animal subjects that employed EIT for perfusion imaging, with promising results in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) and pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as other potential applications. In our opinion, PE is most likely to become the main focus for perfusion EIT in the future, especially for heavily instrumented patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the monitoring capacity of modern electrical impedance tomography (EIT) as an indicator of regional lung aeration and tidal volume distribution. DESIGN AND SETTING: Short-term ventilation experiment in an animal research laboratory. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: One newborn piglet (body weight: 2 kg). INTERVENTIONS: Surfactant depletion by repeated bronchoalveolar lavage, surfactant administration. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: EIT scanning was performed at an acquisition rate of 13 images/s during two ventilatory manoeuvres performed before and after surfactant administration. During the scanning periods of 120 s the piglet was ventilated with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg at positive end-expiratory pressures (PEEP) in the range of 0-30 cmH(2)O, increasing and decreasing in 5 cmH(2)O steps. Local changes in aeration and ventilation with PEEP were visualised by EIT scans showing the regional shifts in end-expiratory lung volume and distribution of tidal volume, respectively. In selected regions of interest EIT clearly identified the changes in local aeration and tidal volume distribution over time and after surfactant treatment as well as the differences between stepwise inflation and deflation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that modern EIT devices provide an assessment of regional lung aeration and tidal volume and allow evaluation of immediate effects of a change in ventilation or other therapeutic intervention. Future use of EIT in a clinical setting is expected to optimise the selection of appropriate ventilation strategies.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) reconstructs images of electrical tissue properties within a body from electrical transfer impedance measurements at surface electrodes. Reconstruction of EIT images requires the solution of an inverse problem in soft field tomography, where a sensitivity matrix, J, of the relationship between internal changes and measurements is calculated, and then a pseudo-inverse of J is used to update the image estimate. It is therefore clear that a precise calculation of J is required for solution accuracy. Since it is generally not possible to use analytic solutions, the finite element method (FEM) is typically used. It has generally been recommended in the EIT literature that FEMs be refined near electrodes, since the electric field and sensitivity is largest there. In this paper we analyze the accuracy requirement for FEM refinement near electrodes in EIT and describe a technique to refine arbitrary FEMs.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) estimates an image of change in electrical properties within a body from stimulations and measurements at surface electrodes. There is significant interest in EIT as a tool to monitor and guide ventilation therapy in mechanically ventilated patients. In lung EIT, the EIT inverse problem is commonly linearized and only changes in electrical properties are reconstructed. Early algorithms reconstructed changes in resistivity, while most recent work using the finite element method reconstructs conductivity. Recently, we demonstrated that EIT images of ventilation can be misleading if the electrical contrasts within the thorax are not taken into account during the image reconstruction process. In this paper, we explore the effect of the choice of the reconstructed electrical properties (resistivity or conductivity) on the resulting EIT images. We show in simulation and experimental data that EIT images reconstructed with the same algorithm but with different parametrizations lead to large and clinically significant differences in the resulting images, which persist even after attempts to eliminate the impact of the parameter choice by recovering volume changes from the EIT images. Since there is no consensus among the most popular reconstruction algorithms and devices regarding the parametrization, this finding has implications for potential clinical use of EIT. We propose a program of research to develop reconstruction techniques that account for both the relationship between air volume and electrical properties of the lung and artefacts introduced by the linearization.},

abstract = {The feasibility and limits in performing tomographic bioluminescence imaging with a combined optical-PET (OPET) system were explored by simulating its image formation process. A micro-MRI based virtual mouse phantom was assigned appropriate tissue optical properties to each of its segmented internal organs at wavelengths spanning the emission spectrum of the firefly luciferase at 37 degrees C. The TOAST finite-element code was employed to simulate the diffuse transport of photons emitted from bioluminescence sources in the mouse. OPET measurements were simulated for single-point, two-point and distributed bioluminescence sources located in different organs such as the liver, the kidneys and the gut. An expectation maximization code was employed to recover the intensity and location of these simulated sources. It was found that spectrally resolved measurements were necessary in order to perform tomographic bioluminescence imaging. The true location of emission sources could be recovered if the mouse background optical properties were known a priori. The assumption of a homogeneous optical property background proved inadequate for describing photon transport in optically heterogeneous tissues and led to inaccurate source localization in the reconstructed images. The simulation results pointed out specific methodological challenges that need to be addressed before a practical implementation of OPET-based bioluminescence tomography is achieved.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) produces an image of the electrical impedance distribution of tissues in the body, using electrodes that are placed on the periphery of the imaged area. These electrodes inject currents and measure voltages and from these data, the impedance can be computed. Traditional EIT systems usually inject current patterns in a serial manner which means that the impedance is computed from data collected at slightly different times. It is usually also a time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose a method for collecting data concurrently from all of the current patterns in biomedical applications of EIT. This is achieved by injecting current through all of the current injecting electrodes simultaneously, and measuring all of the resulting voltages at once. The signals from various current injecting electrodes are separated by injecting different frequencies through each electrode. This is called frequency-division multiplexing (FDM). At the voltage measurement electrodes, the voltage related to each current injecting electrode is isolated by using Fourier decomposition. In biomedical applications, using different frequencies has important implications due to dispersions as the tissue's electrical properties change with frequency. Another significant issue arises when we are recording data in a dynamic environment where the properties change very fast. This method allows simultaneous measurements of all the current patterns, which may be important in applications where the tissue changes occur in the same time scale as the measurement. We discuss the FDM EIT method from the biomedical point of view and show results obtained with a simple experimental system.},

Most EIT reconstruction algorithms calculate images from data frames independently, although data are actually highly correlated especially in high speed EIT systems. This paper proposes a 4-D EIT image reconstruction for functional EIT. The new approach is developed to directly use prior models of the temporal correlations among images and 3-D spatial correlations among image elements. A fast algorithm is also developed to reconstruct the regularized images. Image reconstruction is posed in terms of an augmented image and measurement vector which are concatenated from a specific number of previous and future frames. The reconstruction is then based on an augmented regularization matrix which reflects the a priori constraints on temporal and 3-D spatial correlations of image elements. A temporal factor reflecting the relative strength of the image correlation is objectively calculated from measurement data. Results show that image reconstruction models which account for inter-element correlations, in both space and time, show improved resolution and noise performance, in comparison to simpler image models.},

abstract = {We have developed a new magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) algorithm, the RSM-MREIT algorithm, for noninvasive imaging of the electrical conductivity distribution using only one component of magnetic flux density. The proposed RSM-MREIT algorithm uses the response surface methodology (RSM) algorithm for optimizing the conductivity distribution through minimizing the errors between the measured and calculated magnetic flux densities. A series of computer simulations has been conducted to assess the performance of the proposed RSM-MREIT algorithm to estimate electrical conductivity values of the scalp, the skull and the brain tissue, in a three-shell piecewise homogeneous head model. Computer simulation studies were conducted in both a spherical and realistic-geometry head model with a single variable (the brain-to-skull conductivity ratio) and three variables (the conductivity of the brain, the skull, and the scalp). The relative error between the target and estimated head conductivity values was less than 12\% for both the single-variable and three-variable simulations. These promising simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed RSM-MREIT algorithm in estimating electrical conductivity values in a piecewise homogeneous head model of the human head, and suggest that the RSM-MREIT algorithm merits further investigation.},

abstract = {In magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT), we try to reconstruct a cross-sectional resistivity (or conductivity) image of a subject. When we inject a current through surface electrodes, it generates a magnetic field. Using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, we can obtain the induced magnetic flux density from MR phase images of the subject. We use recessed electrodes to avoid undesirable artefacts near electrodes in measuring magnetic flux densities. An MREIT image reconstruction algorithm produces cross-sectional resistivity images utilizing the measured internal magnetic flux density in addition to boundary voltage data. In order to develop such an image reconstruction algorithm, we need a three-dimensional forward solver. Given injection currents as boundary conditions, the forward solver described in this paper computes voltage and current density distributions using the finite element method (FEM). Then, it calculates the magnetic flux density within the subject using the Biot-Savart law and FEM. The performance of the forward solver is analysed and found to be enough for use in MREIT for resistivity image reconstructions and also experimental designs and validations. The forward solver may find other applications where one needs to compute voltage, current density and magnetic flux density distributions all within a volume conductor.},

@article{VonSchulthess2006,
abstract = {For the past 5 years, combined positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), or PET/CT, has grown because the PET portion provides information that is very different from that obtainable with other imaging modalities. However, the paucity of anatomic landmarks on PET images makes a consistent "hardware fusion" to anatomic cross-sectional data extremely useful. Clinical experience indicates a single direction: Addition of CT to PET improves specificity foremost, but also sensitivity, and the addition of PET to CT adds sensitivity and specificity in tumor imaging. Thus, PET/CT is a more accurate test than either of its individual components and is probably also better than side-by-side viewing of images from both modalities. The synergistic advantage of adding CT is that the attenuation correction needed for PET can also be derived from the CT data, an advantage not obtainable by integrating PET and magnetic resonance imaging. This makes PET/CT 25\%-30\% faster than PET alone with standard attenuation-correction methods, leading to higher patient throughput and a more comfortable examination, which typically last 30 minutes or less. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT appears to provide relevant information in the staging and therapy monitoring of many tumors, including lung carcinoma, mesothelioma, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and many others, with the notable exception of prostatic cancer. For prostatic cancer, choline derivatives may become useful radiopharmaceuticals. The published literature on the applications of FDG PET/CT in oncology is still limited, but several well-designed studies have demonstrated the benefits of PET/CT.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography of brain function poses special problems because applied current is diverted by the resistive skull. In the past, image resolution was maximized with the use of an electrode addressing protocol with widely spaced drive electrode pairs and use of a multiplexer so that many electrode pairs could be flexibly addressed. The purpose of this study was to develop and test an electrode protocol for a 16-channel semi-parallel system which uses parallel recording channels with fixed wiring, the Kyung Hee University (KHU) Mk1. Ten protocols were tested, all addressing pairs of electrodes for recording or current drive, based on recording with a spiral, spiral with suboccipital electrodes (spiral s-o) and zig-zag configurations, and combinations of current injection from electrode pairs at 180 degrees , 120 degrees and 60 degrees . These were compared by assessing the image reconstruction quality of five simulated perturbations in a homogenous model of the human head and of four epileptic foci in an anatomically realistic model in the presence of realistic noise, in terms of localization error, resolution, image distortion and sensitivity in the region of interest. The spiral s-o with current injection at 180 degrees + 120 degrees + 60 degrees gave the best image quality and permitted reconstruction with a localization error of less than 10\% of the head diameter. This encourages the view that it might be possible to obtain satisfactory images of focal abnormalities in the human brain with 16 scalp electrodes and improved instrumentation avoiding multiplexers on recording circuits.},

abstract = {The assessment of the regional match between alveolar ventilation and perfusion in critically ill patients requires simultaneous measurements of both parameters. Ideally, assessment of lung perfusion should be performed in real-time with an imaging technology that provides, through fast acquisition of sequential images, information about the regional dynamics or regional kinetics of an appropriate tracer. We present a novel electrical impedance tomography (EIT)-based method that quantitatively estimates regional lung perfusion based on first-pass kinetics of a bolus of hypertonic saline contrast. Pulmonary blood flow was measured in six piglets during control and unilateral or bilateral lung collapse conditions. The first-pass kinetics method showed good agreement with the estimates obtained by single-photon-emission computerized tomography (SPECT). The mean difference (SPECT minus EIT) between fractional blood flow to lung areas suffering atelectasis was -0.6\%, with a SD of 2.9\%. This method outperformed the estimates of lung perfusion based on impedance pulsatility. In conclusion, we describe a novel method based on EIT for estimating regional lung perfusion at the bedside. In both healthy and injured lung conditions, the distribution of pulmonary blood flow as assessed by EIT agreed well with the one obtained by SPECT. The method proposed in this study has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the behavior of regional perfusion under different lung and therapeutic conditions.},

@article{Brown1987,
abstract = {Because of the intrinsically low sensitivity of any surface potential measurement to resistivity changes within a volume conductor, any data collection system for impedance imaging must be sensitive to changes in the peripheral potential profile of the order of 0.1\%. For example, whilst the resistivity changes associated with lung ventilation and the movement of blood during the cardiac cycle range from 3 to 100\% the changes recorded at the surface are very much less than this. The Sheffield data collection system uses 16 electrodes which are addressed through 4 multiplexers. Overall system accuracy is largely determined by the front-end equivalent circuit which is considered in some detail. This equivalent circuit must take into account wiring and multiplexer capacitances. A current drive of 5 mA p-p at 5 kHz is multiplexed to adjacent pairs of electrodes and peripheral potential profiles are recorded by serially stepping around adjacent electrode pairs. The existing Sheffield system collects the 208 data points for one image in 79 ms and offers 10 image data sets per second to the microprocessor. For a homogeneous circular conductor the ratio of the maximum to minimum signals within each peripheral potential profile is 45:1. The temptation to increase the number of electrodes in order to improve resolution is great and an achievable performance for 128 electrodes is given. However, any improvement in spatial resolution can only be made at the expense of speed and sensitivity which may well be the more important factors in determining the clinical utility of APT.},

Intraindividual variability is a hindrance in serial ECG analysis, where ECGs of the same individual, but taken at different times, are compared. Two sources of intraindividual variability can be distinguished as follows: variability related to the technical circumstances during ECG recording (technical sources) and nonpathologic biologic variability (biological sources). Among the technical sources, variation in electrode positioning between recordings is the most confusing. Of the biological sources, respiratory variations are effective at any time scale, but the most important are age and weight that work on prolonged time scales. Technical problems are best prevented by rigorously sticking to a standard acquisition protocol. Criteria can be adapted to changing circumstances (age, weight), and by computer modeling, it may be possible to correct the ECG diagnosis for some sources of intraindividual variability.},

In this study, we systematically analyzed the range of activity concentration changes, hence SUV, for lung lesions. METHODS: Five lung cancer patients were scanned with PET/CT. In CT, data were acquired in correlation with the real-time positioning. CT images were acquired, in cine mode, at 0.45-s intervals for slightly longer (1 s) than a full respiratory cycle at each couch position. Other scanning parameters were a 0.5-s gantry rotation, 140 kVp, 175 mA, 10-mm couch increments, and a 2.5-mm slice thickness. PET data were acquired after intravenous injection of about 444-555 MBq of (18)F-FDG with a 1-h uptake period. The scanning time was 3 min per bed position for PET. Regularity in breathing was assisted by audio coaching. A commercial software program was then used to sort the acquired CT images into 10 phases, with 0\% corresponding to end of inspiration (EI) and 50\% corresponding to end of expiration (EE). Using the respiration-correlated CT data, images were rebinned to match the PET slice locations and thickness. RESULTS: We analyzed 8 lesions from 5 patients. Reconstructed PET emission data showed up to a 24\% variation in the lesion maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) between EI and EE phases. Examination of all the phases showed an SUV variation of up to 30\%. Also, in some cases the lesion showed up to a 9-mm shift in location and up to a 21\% reduction in size when measured from PET during the EI phase, compared with during the EE phase. CONCLUSION: Using respiration-correlated CT for attenuation correction, we were able to quantitate the fluctuations in PET SUVs. Because those changes may lead to estimates of lower SUVs, the respiratory phase during CT transmission scanning needs to be measured or lung motion has to be regulated for imaging lung cancer in routine clinical practice.},

abstract = {Previous studies have examined the influence of body position, respiration, and habitus on body surface potentials. However, the authors could only estimate the sources of the effects they documented. Among the proposed origin of changes in body surface potentials from those studies were the position of the heart, alterations in autonomic tone, differences in ventricular blood volume, and variations in torso resistivity. The goal of this study was to investigate specifically the role of geometric factors in altering body surface potentials and the electrocardiogram. For this, we used experiments with an isolated, perfused dog heart suspended in a realistically shaped electrolytic torso tank. The experimental preparation allowed us to measure epicardial and tank surface potentials simultaneously, and then reconstruct the geometry of both surfaces. Our results mimicked some of the features described by previous investigators. However, our results also showed differences that included considerably larger changes in the peak QRS and T-wave amplitudes with heart movement than those reported in human studies. We detected smaller values of root-mean-squared variability from heart movements than those reported in a human study comparing body surface potentials during change in inspiration and body position. There was better agreement with relative variability, which in these studies ranged from 0.11 to 0.42, agreeing well with an estimate from human studies of 0.40. Our results suggest that the isolated heart/torso tank preparation is a valuable tool for investigating the effects of geometric variation. Furthermore, the geometric position of the heart appears to be a large source of variation in body surface potentials. The size of these variations easily exceeded thresholds used to distinguish pathologic conditions and thus such variations could have important implications on the interpretation of the standard electrocardiogram.},

abstract = {Validation studies of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) based assessment of regional ventilation under pathological conditions are required to prove that EIT can reliably quantify heterogeneous ventilation distribution with sufficient accuracy. The objective of our study was to validate EIT measurements of regional ventilation through a comparison with xenon-multidetector-row computed tomography (XeCT) in an animal model of sub-lobar lung injury. Nine anesthetized mechanically ventilated supine pigs were examined before and after the induction of lung injury in two adjacent sub-lobar segments of the right lung by saline lavage or endotoxin instillation. Regional ventilation was determined in 32 anteroposterior regions of interest in the right and left lungs and the ventilation change quantified by difference images between injury and control. Six animals were included in the final analysis. Measurements of regional ventilation by EIT and XeCT correlated well before (rs = 0.89 right, rs = 0.90 left lung) and after local injury (rs = 0.79 and 0.92, respectively). No bias and narrow limits of agreement were found during both conditions. The ventilation decrease in the right injured lung was correspondingly measured by both modalities (5.5\%±1.1\% by EIT and 5.4\%±1.9\% by XeCT, p = 0.94). EIT was inferior to clearly separate the exact anatomical location of the regional injuries. Regional ventilation was overestimated (<2\%) in the most ventral and dorsal regions and underestimated (2\%) in the middle regions by EIT compared to XeCT. This study shows that EIT is able to reliably discern even small ventilation changes on sub-lobar level.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We evaluate a fully data-driven method for the combined recovery and motion blur correction of small solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) in F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). METHODS: The SPN was segmented in the low-dose CT using a variable Hounsfield threshold and morphological constraints. The combined effect of limited spatial resolution and motion blur in the SPN's PET image was then modelled by an effective Gaussian point-spread function (psf). Both isotropic and non-isotropic psfs were used. To validate the method, PET/CT measurements of the NEMA/IEC spheres phantom were performed. The method was applied to 50 unselected SPNs <or=30 mm from routine patient care. RESULTS: Recovery of standardised uptake value (SUV) in the phantom image was significantly improved by combined recovery and motion blur correction compared with recovery-only correction, particularly with the non-isotropic model (residual average error 10\%). In the patient images, automated segmentation and fit of the effective psf worked properly in all cases. Volume-equivalent diameter ranged from 4.9 to 27.8 mm. Uncorrected maximum SUV ranged from 0.9 to 13.3. Compared with recovery-only correction, combined correction with the non-isotropic model resulted in a 'relevant' (>or=30\%) SUV increase in 47 SPNs (94\%). CONCLUSIONS: Correction of both recovery and motion blur is mandatory for accurate SUV quantification of SPNs.},

Recognizing that significant local disease or dysfunction can exist before global measures begin to deteriorate, the motivation for the development and application of these regional techniques is to further our understanding of the basic pathophysiological characteristics of evolving lung disease and, ultimately, develop sensitive measures for its early detection. This review emphasizes the key elements of ventilation and lung mechanics relevant for regional approaches and CT measurement principles available for their study. Examples of established and evolving methods for imaging regional ventilation and mechanics, including the xenon CT ventilation method; the relationship between changing regional CT density and air volume change; and registration-based methods for examining regional lung expansion and strain, are presented.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To establish the value of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in assessing pulmonary edema in noncardiogenic acute respiratory failure (ARF), as compared to the thermal dye double indicator dilution technique (TDD).

DESIGN: Prospective clinical study.

SETTING: ICU of a general hospital.

PATIENTS: Fourteen ARF patients.

INTERVENTIONS: In order to use the TDD to determine the amount of extravascular lung water (EVLW), a fiberoptic catheter was placed in the femoral artery. Measurements and main results: Fourteen consecutive ARF patients receiving mechanical ventilation were measured by EIT and TDD. EIT visualizes the impedance changes caused by the ventilation in two-dimensional image planes. An impedance ratio (IR) of the ventilation-induced impedance changes of a posterior and an anterior part of the lungs was used to indicate the amount of EVLW. For the 29 measurements in 14 patients, a significant correlation between EIT and TDD (r = 0. 85; p < 0.001) was found. The EIT reproducibility was good. The diagnostic value of the method was tested by receiver operator characteristic analysis, with 10 mL/kg of EVLW considered as the upper limit of normal. At a cutoff level of the IR of 0.64, the IR had a sensitivity of 93\%, a specificity of 87\%, and a positive predictive value of 87\% for a supranormal amount of EVLW. Follow-up measurements were performed in 11 patients. A significant correlation was found between the changes in EVLW measured with EIT and TDD (r = 0.85; p < 0.005).

CONCLUSION: We conclude that EIT is a noninvasive technique for reasonably estimating the amount of EVLW in noncardiogenic ARF.},

abstract = {Regional lung overdistension occurring during high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and partial liquid ventilation (PLV) was investigated in a prospective animal trial using 18 mechanically ventilated Yorkshire swine under general anesthesia. Lung injury was induced with saline lavage and augmented using large tidal volumes. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and regional lung histopathology were used to identify regional lung overdistension during HFOV. Lung injury was quantified using a histopathologic lung injury score. The animals were randomized to three groups (n = 6 animals in each group): a control group and two dose groups of perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) (PFOB-Lo 1.5 ml kg(-1) and PFOB-Hi 3 ml kg(-1)). The nimals were transitioned from conventional ventilation to HFOV, and a slow inflation-deflation maneuver was performed by changing mean airway pressure (Paw) by 5 cmH(2)O every 15 min to a maximum Paw of 40 cmH(2)O. In dependent lung areas, the PFOB-Hi (3 ml kg(-1)) group, in comparison with the control group, was associated with significantly greater alveolar overdistension seen on lung histopathology (P < 0.001 compared to control), a decreased mean impedance (P < 0.05 compared to the control group) and a decreased ventilation-induced impedance change during HFOV (P < 0.05 compared to the control group). We conclude that treatment with PFOB-Hi during HFOV compared to a control group in an animal model of lung injury led to regional overdistension of dependent lung areas, as evidenced by increased alveolar overdistension on lung histopathology, decreased mean lung impedance and decreased HFOV-induced regional lung volume changes as measured by EIT.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) calculates the internal conductivity distribution within a body using electrical contact measurements. Conventional EIT reconstruction methods solve a linear model by minimizing the least squares error, i.e., the Euclidian or L2-norm, with regularization. Compressed sensing provides unique advantages in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) [1] when the images are transformed to a sparse basis. EIT images are generally sparser than MRI images due to their lower spatial resolution. This leads us to investigate ability of compressed sensing algorithms currently applied to MRI in EIT without transformation to a new basis. In particular, we examine four new iterative algorithms for L1 and L0 minimization with applications to compressed sensing and compare these with current EIT inverse L1-norm regularization methods. The four compressed sensing methods are as follows: (1) an interior point method for solving L1-regularized least squares problems (L1-LS); (2) total variation using a Lagrangian multiplier method (TVAL3); (3) a two-step iterative shrinkage / thresholding method (TWIST) for solving the L0-regularized least squares problem; (4) The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) with tracing the Pareto curve, which estimates the least squares parameters subject to a L1-norm constraint. In our investigation, using 1600 elements, we found all four CS algorithms provided an improvement over the best conventional EIT reconstruction method, Total Variation, in three important areas: robustness to noise, increased computational speed of at least 40x and a visually apparent improvement in spatial resolution. Out of the four CS algorithms we found TWIST was the fastest with at least a 100x speed increase.},

abstract = {Cross-sectional imaging of an electrical conductivity distribution inside the human body has been an active research goal in impedance imaging. By injecting current into an electrically conducting object through surface electrodes, we induce current density and voltage distributions. Based on the fact that these are determined by the conductivity distribution as well as the geometry of the object and the adopted electrode configuration, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) reconstructs cross-sectional conductivity images using measured current-voltage data on the surface. Unfortunately, there exist inherent technical difficulties in EIT. First, the relationship between the boundary current-voltage data and the internal conductivity distribution bears a nonlinearity and low sensitivity, and hence the inverse problem of recovering the conductivity distribution is ill posed. Second, it is difficult to obtain accurate information on the boundary geometry and electrode positions in practice, and the inverse problem is sensitive to these modeling errors as well as measurement artifacts and noise. These result in EIT images with a poor spatial resolution. In order to produce high-resolution conductivity images, magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) has been lately developed. Noting that injection current produces a magnetic as well as electric field inside the imaging object, we can measure the induced internal magnetic flux density data using an MRI scanner. Utilization of the internal magnetic flux density is the key idea of MREIT to overcome the technical difficulties in EIT. Following original ideas on MREIT in early 1990s, there has been a rapid progress in its theory, algorithm and experimental techniques. The technique has now advanced to the stage of human experiments. Though it is still a few steps away from routine clinical use, its potential is high as a new impedance imaging modality providing conductivity images with a spatial resolution of a few millimeters or less. This paper reviews MREIT from the basics to the most recent research outcomes. Focusing on measurement techniques and experimental methods rather than mathematical issues, we summarize what has been done and what needs to be done. Suggestions for future research directions, possible applications in biomedicine, biology, chemistry and material science are discussed.},

We describe the derivation and characterization of porcine tumor cell lines with initial efforts of tumor transplantation using immunocompromised mice and highly inbred sublines of Massachusetts General Hospital major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-inbred miniature swine. Autopsies were performed routinely on swine that died unexpectedly or had suspicion of malignancy based on clinical symptoms or peripheral blood analysis. Tissue samples were obtained for pathology, phenotyped by flow cytometry, and placed in culture. Based on growth, lines were selected for passage into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice and miniature swine. Porcine tumor recipients were preconditioned with total body irradiation from 0 to 500 cGy or with a 30-day course of oral cyclosporine. We identified 19 cases of hematologic tumors. Nine distinct tumor cell lines were established from 8 of these cases, including 3 derived from highly inbred sublines. In vivo tumor growth and serial transfer were observed in immunocompromised mice for one tumor cell line and in miniature swine for 1 of 2 tumor cell lines expanded for this purpose. These results suggest the possibility of developing a transplantable tumor model in this large-animal system.},

abstract = {We propose a new impedance imaging method, electromagnetic impedance tomography (EMIT), in which the boundary electric potential measurements in electrical impedance tomography (EIT) are augmented by measurements of the exterior magnetic field induced by the currents excited in the object by the standard EIT procedures. These magnetic measurements can be obtained reliably and inexpensively by simple pickup coils located around the imaged cross section. We derive expressions for the forward problem and for the Jacobian of the measurements, and propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm using a squared error cost function. The performance of EMIT and EIT is compared in numerical simulations using a finite-element model for the conductivity distribution of several phantoms. Evaluation of the rank and condition of the Jacobian demonstrates that the additional magnetic measurements provided by a few pickup coils in EMIT turn an underdetermined EIT problem into a well-posed one with reasonable condition, or significantly improve the conditioning of the EIT problem when it is already fully determined. Reconstructions of various phantoms reveal that EMIT provides particularly significant visual and quantitative improvement (threefold to tenfold reduction in the root-mean-squared error) in the sensitivity at the center of the object, which is the area most difficult to image using EIT.},

abstract = {Spirometry and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) data from 26 healthy subjects (14 males, 12 females) were used to develop a model linking contrast variations in EIT difference images to lung volume changes. Eight recordings, each 64 s long, were made for each subject in four postures (standing, sitting, reclining at 45 degrees, supine) and two breathing modes (quiet tidal and deep breathing). Age, gender and five anthropometric variables were recorded. The database was divided into four subsets. The first subset, data from 22 subjects (12 males, 10 females) recorded in deep breathing mode, was used to create the model. Validation was done with the other subsets: data recorded during quiet tidal breathing in the same 22 subjects, and data recorded in both breathing modes for the other four subjects. A quadratic equation in DeltaV(P) (lung volume changes recorded by the spirometer) provided a very good fit to total contrast changes in the EIT images. The model coefficients were found to depend on posture, gender, thoracic circumference and scapular skin fold. To validate the model, the quadratic equation was inverted to estimate lung volume changes from the EIT images. The estimated changes were then compared to the measured volume changes. Validations with each data subset yielded mean standard errors ranging from 9.3\% to 12.4\%. The proposed model is a first step in enabling inter individual comparisons of EIT images since: (1) it provides a framework for incorporating the effects of anthropometric variables, gender and posture, and (2) it references the images to a physical quantity (volume) verifiable by spirometry.},

abstract = {Assessing the performance of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) systems usually requires a phantom for validation, calibration, or comparison purposes. This paper describes a resistive mesh phantom to assess the performance of EIT systems while taking into account cabling stray effects similar to in vivo conditions. This phantom is built with 340 precision resistors on a printed circuit board representing a 2-D circular homogeneous medium. It also integrates equivalent electrical models of the Ag/AgCl electrode impedances. The parameters of the electrode models were fitted from impedance curves measured with an impedance analyzer. The technique used to build the phantom is general and applicable to phantoms of arbitrary shape and conductivity distribution. We describe three performance indicators that can be measured with our phantom for every measurement of an EIT data frame: SNR, accuracy, and modeling accuracy. These performance indicators were evaluated on our EIT system under different frame rates and applied current intensities. The performance indicators are dependent on frame rate, operating frequency, applied current intensity, measurement strategy, and intermodulation distortion when performing simultaneous measurements at several frequencies. These parameter values should, therefore, always be specified when reporting performance indicators to better appreciate their significance.},

We present a numerical solution using the finite-element method that has been modified for modelling anisotropic conductive media. It was validated in an anisotropic domain against an analytical solution in an isotropic medium after the isotropic domain was diffeomorphically transformed into an anisotropic one. Convergence of the finite element to the analytical solution was verified by showing that the finite-element error norm decreased linearly related to the finite-element size, as the mesh density increased, for the simplified case of Laplace's equation in a cubic domain with a Dirichlet boundary condition.},

abstract = {One promising application of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is the monitoring of pulmonary ventilation and edema. Using three-dimensional (3D) finite difference human models as virtual phantoms, the factors that contribute to the observed lung resistivity changes in the EIT images were investigated. The results showed that the factors included not only tissue resistivity or vessel volume changes, but also chest expansion and tissue/organ movement. The chest expansion introduced artifacts in the center of the EIT images, ranging from -2\% to 31\% of the image magnitude. With the increase of simulated chest expansion, the percentage contribution of chest expansion relative to lung resistivity change in the EIT image remained relatively constant. The averaged resistivity changes in the lung regions caused by chest expansion ranged from 0.65\% to 18.31\%. Tissue/organ movement resulted in an increased resistivity in the lung region and in the center anterior region of EIT images. The increased resistivity with inspiration observed in the heart region was caused mainly by a drop in the heart position, which reduced the heart area at the electrode level and was replaced by the lung tissue with higher resistivity. This study indicates that for the analysis of EIT, data errors caused by chest expansion and tissue/organ movement need to be considered.},

abstract = {The benefit of treating acute lung injury with recruitment manoeuvres is controversial. An impediment to settling this debate is the difficulty in visualizing how distinct lung regions respond to the manoeuvre. Here, regional lung mechanics were studied by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) during a stepwise recruitment manoeuvre in a porcine model with acute lung injury. The following interaction between dependent and non-dependent regions consistently occurred: atelectasis in the most dependent region was reversed only after the non-dependent region became overdistended. EIT estimates of overdistension and atelectasis were validated by histological examination of lung tissue, confirming that the dependent region was primarily atelectatic and the non-dependent region was primarily overdistended. The pulmonary pressure-volume equation, originally designed for modelling measurements at the airway opening, was adapted for EIT-based regional estimates of overdistension and atelectasis. The adaptation accurately modelled the regional EIT data from dependent and non-dependent regions (R(2) > 0.93, P < 0.0001) and predicted their interaction during recruitment. In conclusion, EIT imaging of regional lung mechanics reveals that overdistension in the non-dependent region precedes atelectasis reversal in the dependent region during a stepwise recruitment manoeuvre.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomographic spectroscopy measurements of the lungs are taken from nine normal subjects, in the frequency range 9.6 kHz-1.2 MHz. The results show that resistivity rho'FRC relative to functional residual capacity increases almost linearly with inspiration volume V, with the slope of the curve increasing with frequency f. Resistivity rho'9.6 kHz relative to 9.6 kHz decreases with f. rho'9.6 kHz increases with V, at any given frequency. Curves for rho'9.6 kHz show a roughly linear trend with log10(f). Based on a discussion of the measurement results, a mathematical lung tissue model is designed that involves extra-capillary blood vessels and alveoli, the walls of which consist of blood-filled capillaries, epithelial cells and intercellular liquid. Using this model, the increase in rho'FRC with V is explained by the thinning of alveolar walls with increasing air content. The almost linear shape of curves for rho'9.6 kHz is attributed to four partly overlapping main dispersions caused by extra-capillary blood vessels, epithelial cells, blood and the capillary network.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance electrical property tomography (MREPT) is a new imaging modality to visualize a distribution of admittivity $\gamma$ = $\sigma$+i$\omega$$\epsilon$ inside the human body where $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ denote electrical conductivity and permittivity, respectively. Using B1 maps acquired by an magnetic resonance imaging scanner, it produces cross-sectional images of $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ at the Larmor frequency. Since current MREPT methods rely on an assumption of a locally homogeneous admittivity, there occurs a reconstruction error where this assumption fails. Rigorously analyzing the reconstruction error in MREPT, we showed that the error is fundamental and may cause technical difficulties in interpreting MREPT images of a general inhomogeneous object. We performed numerical simulations and phantom experiments to quantitatively support the error analysis. We compared the MREPT image reconstruction problem with that of magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) to highlight distinct features of both methods to probe the same object in terms of its high- and low-frequency conductivity distributions, respectively. MREPT images showed large errors along boundaries where admittivity values changed whereas MREIT images showed no such boundary effects. Noting that MREIT makes use of the term neglected in MREPT, a novel MREPT admittivity image reconstruction method is proposed to deal with the boundary effects, which requires further investigation on the complex directional derivative in the real Euclidian space [Formula: see text].},

The level-set-based reconstruction method (LSRM) allows the reconstruction of non-smooth interfaces between image regions, which are typically smoothed by traditional voxel-based reconstruction methods (VBRMs). We develop a time difference formulation of the LSRM for 2D images. The proposed reconstruction method is applied to reconstruct clinical EIT data of a slow flow inflation pressure-volume manoeuvre in lung-healthy and adult lung-injury patients. Images from the LSRM and the VBRM are compared. The results show comparable reconstructed images, but with an improved ability to reconstruct sharp conductivity changes in the distribution of lung ventilation using the LSRM.},

abstract = {There is emerging evidence that the ventilation strategy used in acute lung injury (ALI) makes a significant difference in outcome and that an inappropriate ventilation strategy may produce ventilator-associated lung injury. Most harmful during mechanical ventilation are lung overdistension and lung collapse or atelectasis. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) as a non-invasive imaging technology may be helpful to identify lung areas at risk. Currently, no automated method is routinely available to identify lung areas that are overdistended, collapsed or ventilated appropriately. We propose a fuzzy logic-based algorithm to analyse EIT images obtained during stepwise changes of mean airway pressures during mechanical ventilation. The algorithm is tested on data from two published studies of stepwise inflation-deflation manoeuvres in an animal model of ALI using conventional and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. The timing of lung opening and collapsing on segmented images obtained using the algorithm during an inflation-deflation manoeuvre is in agreement with well-known effects of surfactant administration and changes in shunt fraction. While the performance of the algorithm has not been verified against a gold standard, we feel that it presents an important first step in tackling this challenging and important problem.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) offers a possibility of realizing of a low cost and safe modality for clinically monitoring patients being treated with mechanical ventilation. However, image reconstruction algorithm employed at different clinical or research settings varies from one to another, which in turn makes interpretation of regional ventilation across institutions difficult. Seeing the lack of a standardized algorithm, GREIT (Graz consensus Reconstruction algorithm for EIT) was proposed lately in an attempt to develop a unified EIT image reconstruction algorithm. To assess GREIT, an anatomically-detailed electrical model of the thorax is indispensable. In view of this need, we describe a high resolution, image-based electrical thoracic modeling software environment, named MEFS (MIND EIT Forward Solver). The software environment utilizes anatomically realistic geometry of the thorax, allows placing electrode of any shape interactively, and yields the detailed field information in the simulated volume. The goals of the development of MEFS are: 1) to generate electrical measurements needed for EIT image reconstruction, 2) to provide a platform to compare various EIT reconstruction algorithms.},

@article{Carvalho2011,
abstract = {In acute lung injury (ALI), pressure support ventilation (PSV) may improve oxygenation compared with pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV), and benefit from random variation of pressure support (noisy PSV). We investigated the effects of PCV, PSV, and noisy PSV on gas exchange as well as the distribution of lung aeration and perfusion in 12 pigs with ALI induced by saline lung lavage in supine position. After injury, animals were mechanically ventilated with PCV, PSV, and noisy PSV for 1 h/mode in random sequence. The driving pressure was set to a mean tidal volume of 6 ml/kg and positive end-expiratory pressure to 8 cmH₂O in all modes. Functional variables were measured, and the distribution of lung aeration was determined by static and dynamic computed tomography (CT), whereas the distribution of pulmonary blood flow (PBF) was determined by intravenously administered fluorescent microspheres. PSV and noisy PSV improved oxygenation and reduced venous admixture compared with PCV. Mechanical ventilation with PSV and noisy PSV did not decrease nonaerated areas but led to a redistribution of PBF from dorsal to ventral lung regions and reduced tidal reaeration and hyperinflation compared with PCV. Noisy PSV further improved oxygenation and redistributed PBF from caudal to cranial lung regions compared with conventional PSV. We conclude that assisted ventilation with PSV and noisy PSV improves oxygenation compared with PCV through redistribution of PBF from dependent to nondependent zones without lung recruitment. Random variation of pressure support further redistributes PBF and improves oxygenation compared with conventional PSV.},

@article{Bundschuh2007,
abstract = {One of the main degrading factors in the quality of oncologic PET images of the thorax and upper abdomen is respiratory motion of tumors. One method to reduce this effect is the acquisition of PET data in gated mode. A second method is the correction of studies for motion. Motion registration is essential in both cases. We report a method using list-mode data to detect the craniocaudal (z) movement of thoracic and abdominal lesions without using any external gating device. The aim of this study was to show the feasibility of applying this method to patient data. METHODS: For 10 patients with lesions in the lung or upper abdominal organs, images for short time bins of 250, 500, and 750 ms were reconstructed. A volume of interest, which was manually defined in a summed image around the structure of interest, was projected to each time bin. The center of mass of the activity distribution in this volume of interest was determined for each case. The curves of the z-coordinate of the center of mass (z(COM)) over the time were analyzed and compared with respiration curves obtained by a pressure-sensitive belt. RESULTS: In 7 of the 10 patients, movement of the lesion was registered in good accordance with the pressure belt. In the 3 remaining patients, no changes in the center of mass due to respiration could be detected, most likely because of minimal respiratory motion. The maximal difference in z(COM) for a lesion that was detected within the 10-min acquisition was 18.5 mm. For 7 of the 10 patients, the mean value for each respiration amplitude was between 11.0 and 2.0 mm. CONCLUSION: We have shown the feasibility of registering movement of high-uptake lesions without the use of any external device that may restrain the patient. Furthermore, unlike external sensors, this method quantifies internal motion and, thus, is a promising base for correction methods.},

This method is applied to SPECT images that show a preserved activity distribution in the lungs such as 99m-Tc macro aggregated albumin (99m-Tc-MAA) perfusion images and 99m-Tc-Technegas ventilation images. In the proposed method, an objective function, which consists of both the degree of similarity between a reference image and a deformed image, and the smoothness of deformation is defined and optimized using a simulated annealing algorithm. For the degree of similarity term in the objective function, an expansion ratio, defined as the ratio of change in local volume due to deformation, is introduced to preserve the total activity during the motion correction process. This method was applied to data simulated from computer phantoms, data acquired from a physical phantom, and 17 sets of clinical data. In all cases, the motion correction between inspiration and expiration phase images was successfully achieved.},

A total of 25 patients were measured using a compact steady-state diffuse reflectance/fluorescence spectrometer and a fibre-optic-coupled multispectral time-resolved spectrofluorometer. Measurements were performed in vivo prior to surgical excision of the investigated region. Singular value decomposition was used to reduce the dimensionality of steady state diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectra. Linear discriminant analysis was then applied to the measurements of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and used to predict the tissue disease state with a leave-one-out methodology. This approach was able to correctly diagnose 87\% of the BCCs. With 445 nm excitation a decrease in the spectrally averaged fluorescence lifetime was observed between normal tissue and BCC lesions with a mean value of 886 ps. Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetime for BCCs was lower than that of the surrounding healthy tissue in all cases and statistical analysis of the data revealed that this decrease was significant (p = 0.002).},

abstract = {Trans-thoracical electrical impedance measurements on a human subject have been performed using the Sheffield equipment. These measured transfer impedances are compared with computed ones, based on an inhomogeneous, torso-shaped volume conductor, for different values of the overall electrical conductivities sigma l and sigma r of left and right lung. Each measured set of impedances is compared with all calculated sets. The remaining (minimum) residual difference epsilon is used as a measure of the goodness of fit, and the values of sigma l and sigma r for which epsilon is minimal are taken as representing the overall conductivities of the lungs. For data measured at various stages within the respiratory cycle, sigma l and sigma r have been determined. The results are found to relate well to physiology: for a measurement taken at maximum expiration sigma l and sigma r indicate almost homogeneity, whereas for end inspiratory level sigma l and sigma r tend towards values of 0.2, which is a realistic value for the relative conductivity of lung tissue.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose a single magnetic resonance scan conductivity imaging technique providing dual-frequency characteristics of tissue conductivity. METHODS: Using a modified spin-echo pulse sequence, the magnetic flux density induced by externally injected currents and the B1+ phase map with injected current effects removed were acquired simultaneously. The low-frequency conductivity was reconstructed from the measured magnetic flux density by the projected current density method, while the high-frequency conductivity was reconstructed using the B1+ maps. Three different conductivity phantoms were used to demonstrate low- and high-frequency conductivity characteristics. RESULTS: A conductivity spectrum at two frequencies was successfully acquired with the proposed scheme. Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography is advantageous for seeing an anomaly itself wrapped with a thin insulating membrane. In addition, if the membrane is porous, the membrane property can be quantitatively visualized with magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography. Magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography does not detect such membranes, which enable it to probe things inside an insulating membrane. CONCLUSION: Considering these pros and cons and also the fact that the conductivity of biological tissue changes with frequency, a dual-frequency conductivity imaging incorporating both magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography and magnetic resonance electrical properties tomography in future animal and human experiments is suggested.},

abstract = {Imaging the electrical properties of human tissue may aid in cancer diagnoses or monitoring organ function. Traditionally, the electrical properties are revealed with electrical impedance tomography, where currents are injected into human tissue and voltages are measured on the surface. This paper focuses on a method of measuring the electrical properties using a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner without current injection. In magnetic resonance driven electrical impedance tomography (MRDEIT), the MR phenomenon is used to induce currents in the body and the complex permittivity map is inversely computed from the difference between the modeled electric field and the actual surface electrode measurements. Computer simulations indicate that with noise level under 20\%, the contrast is visually discernible in the reconstruction image. A phantom experiment is demonstrated and this supports results from computer simulation studies. The noise level in electrode measurements is evaluated to be approximately 7.8\% from repeated experiments, confirming the potential to reconstruct conductivity contrast using MRDEIT. With further improvements in hardware and image reconstruction, MRDEIT may provide an additional contrast mechanism reflecting the electrical properties of human tissue, which may ultimately be used to diagnose a cancer or assist in electroencephalography.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to quantify patterns of age-related shape change in the human thorax using Procrustes superimposition. Landmarks (n=106) selected from anonymized computed tomography (CT) scans of 63 adult males free of skeletal pathology were used to describe the form of the rib cage. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine a relationship between landmark location and age. Linear and quadratic models were also investigated. A permutation test employing 1 x 10(5) random trials was used to assess the model significance for both model formulations. Linear relationships between the centroid size (CS) of a landmark set and the corresponding individual's height, weight, and BMI were conducted to enable scaling of the dimensionless results from the Procrustes analysis. A significance level of alpha=0.05 was used for all tests. The average age of the study subjects was 57.0+/-17.3 years. Complete landmark sets were obtained from most of the scans (44 of 63). The quadratic relationship between the age and landmark location was found to be significant (p=0.037), thereby establishing a relationship between the age and thoracic shape change. The linear relationship was mildly significant as well (p=0.073). Significant relationships between the centroid size of the dataset and subject weight, height and BMI were determined, with the best-correlated value being weight (p=0.002, R(2)=0.22). Landmark datasets calculated using the quadratic model exhibited shape change consistent with the clinical observations (increasing kyphosis and rounding of the thoracic cage). Procrustes superimposition represents a potential improvement in the approach used to generate computational models for injury biomechanics studies. The coefficients from the quadratic model are provided and can be used to generate the complete set of model landmark data points at a given age.},

@article{Bodenstein2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent method determines regional gas flow of the lung by electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The aim of this study is to show the applicability of this method in a porcine model of mechanical ventilation in healthy and diseased lungs. Our primary hypothesis is that global gas flow measured by EIT can be correlated with spirometry. Our secondary hypothesis is that regional analysis of respiratory gas flow delivers physiologically meaningful results.

METHODS: In two sets of experiments n = 7 healthy pigs and n = 6 pigs before and after induction of lavage lung injury were investigated. EIT of the lung and spirometry were registered synchronously during ongoing mechanical ventilation. In-vivo aeration of the lung was analysed in four regions-of-interest (ROI) by EIT: 1) global, 2) ventral (non-dependent), 3) middle and 4) dorsal (dependent) ROI. Respiratory gas flow was calculated by the first derivative of the regional aeration curve. Four phases of the respiratory cycle were discriminated. They delivered peak and late inspiratory and expiratory gas flow (PIF, LIF, PEF, LEF) characterizing early or late inspiration or expiration.

RESULTS: Linear regression analysis of EIT and spirometry in healthy pigs revealed a very good correlation measuring peak flow and a good correlation detecting late flow. PIFEIT = 0.702 · PIFspiro + 117.4, r(2) = 0.809; PEFEIT = 0.690 · PEFspiro-124.2, r(2) = 0.760; LIFEIT = 0.909 · LIFspiro + 27.32, r(2) = 0.572 and LEFEIT = 0.858 · LEFspiro-10.94, r(2) = 0.647. EIT derived absolute gas flow was generally smaller than data from spirometry. Regional gas flow was distributed heterogeneously during different phases of the respiratory cycle. But, the regional distribution of gas flow stayed stable during different ventilator settings. Moderate lung injury changed the regional pattern of gas flow.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the presented method is able to determine global respiratory gas flow of the lung in different phases of the respiratory cycle. Additionally, it delivers meaningful insight into regional pulmonary characteristics, i.e. the regional ability of the lung to take up and to release air.},

abstract = {The topographic matching of alveolar ventilation (V(A)) and perfusion (Q) is the main determinant of gas exchange efficiency of the lung. However, no pulmonary functional imaging technique has been shown to predict whole-lung gas exchange in health and disease. This study aims to present a PET-based method to estimate regional alveolar ventilation-to-perfusion ratios (V(A)/Q) predictive of arterial blood gases. METHODS: The method is based on the regional tracer kinetics of (13)N-nitrogen ((13)NN) after an intravenous bolus injection during a breath-hold period and subsequent washout from the lungs with resumption of breathing. The method takes into account the presence of inter- and intraregional nonuniformities at length scales smaller than the imaging spatial resolution. An algorithm used regional tracer washout to classify regional V(A)Q/ uniformity. Intraregional V(A)/Q mismatch in nonuniform regions was described with a 2-compartment model. Regional V(A)/Q estimates were combined into a whole-lung distribution of V(A)/Q ratios and were used to compute global arterial blood gases. The method was applied to 3-dimensional PET data from anesthetized and mechanically ventilated sheep before and after methacholine bronchoconstriction (n = 3) and pulmonary embolism (n = 3) and after saline lung lavage (n = 3). RESULTS: PET images revealed regional changes in ventilation and perfusion consistent with the different disease models. Quantification of the images using PET-derived V(A)Q/ distributions showed unimodal and narrow distributions in control conditions that became wider and unimodal after pulmonary embolism and saline lung lavage and bimodal after bronchoconstriction. Images of regional gas exchange allowed for visualization of regional gas exchange. Arterial blood gases estimated from the PET-based V(A)/Q distributions closely agreed with measured values (partial pressure of oxygen, arterial [PaO(2)]: r(2) = 0.97, P < 0.001; partial pressure of carbon dioxide, arterial [PaCO(2)]: r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Tracer kinetics analysis of PET images after an intravenous injection of (13)NN provides a quantitative assessment of regional V(A)/Q heterogeneity including that corresponding to length scales smaller than the spatial resolution of the imaging method. Quantification of V(A)/Q mismatch obtained with the presented technique is directly related to severity of gas exchange impairment as determined by arterial blood gases.},

abstract = {PURPOSES: The aim of the study was to use three-dimensional high-resolution CT scan data sets in inspiration and expiration for the quantitative evaluation of emphysema. Using an advanced dedicated semiautomatic analysis tool, the functional inspiratory/expiratory shifts of emphysema volume and clusters were quantified. The pulmonary function test (PFT) served as the clinical "gold standard." MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients (9 women and 22 men; mean [+/- SD] age, 60 +/- 8 years) who had severe emphysema due to COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] class III and IV) were included in the study. All patients underwent paired inspiratory/expiratory multidetector CT scans (slice thickness, 1/0.8 mm) and pulmonary function tests (PFTs). CT scan data were analyzed with self-written emphysema detection solftware. It provides lung volume (LV), emphysema volume (EV), emphysema index (EI), and four clusters of emphysema with different volumes (from 2, 8, 65, and 120 mm(3)). These results were correlated with total lung capacity (TLC), intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV), and residual volume (RV) derived from PFT results. RESULTS: Inspiratory LV correlated with TLC (r = 0.9), expiratory LV with ITGV (r = 0.87), and RV (r = 0.83). Expiratory EV correlated better with ITGV (r = 0.88) and RV (r = 0.93) than with inspiratory EV (r = 0.83 and 0.88, respectively). The mean inspiratory EI was 54 +/- 13\%, and it decreased to 43 +/- 15\% in expiration. However, the individuals showed a broad spectrum of changes of EI (mean, 11\%; range, 1 to 28\%), and no differences in inspiratory/expiratory EI and changes in EI or LV were found between GOLD III and GOLD IV patients. In expiration, there was a change from the large emphysema cluster (-37\%) to the intermediate cluster (+15\%) and small cluster (+13\% and +11\%, respectively). The change of volume of the large emphysema cluster after expiration correlated well with the changes in LV (r = 0.9), EV (r = 0.99), EI (r = 0.85), and MLD (r = 0.76). CONCLUSION: Emphysema volumes measured from expiratory MDCT scans better reflect PFT abnormalities in patients with severe emphysema than those from inspiratory scans. Volumetric cluster analysis provided deeper insights into the local hyperinflation and expiratory obstruction of large emphysematous clusters.},

abstract = {Fluorescence imaging in diffusive media is an emerging imaging modality for medical applications that uses injected fluorescent markers that bind to specific targets, e.g., carcinoma. The region of interest is illuminated with near-IR light and the emitted back fluorescence is analyzed to localize the fluorescence sources. To investigate a thick medium, as the fluorescence signal decreases with the light travel distance, any disturbing signal, such as biological tissues intrinsic fluorescence (called autofluorescence) is a limiting factor. Several specific markers may also be simultaneously injected to bind to different molecules, and one may want to isolate each specific fluorescent signal from the others. To remove the unwanted fluorescence contributions or separate different specific markers, a spectroscopic approach is explored. The nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the blind positive source separation method we chose. We run an original regularized NMF algorithm we developed on experimental data, and successfully obtain separated in vivo fluorescence spectra.},

abstract = {We characterize the ability of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to distinguish changes in internal conductivity distributions, and analyze it as a function of stimulation and measurement patterns. A distinguishability measure, z, is proposed which is related to the signal-to-noise ratio of a medium and to the probability of detection of conductivity changes in a region of interest. z is a function of the number of electrodes, the EIT stimulation and measurement protocol, the stimulation amplitude, the measurement noise, and the size and location of the contrasts. Using this measure we analyze various choices of stimulation and measurement patterns under the constraint of medical electrical safety limits (maximum current into the body). Analysis is performed for a planar placement of 16 electrodes for simulated 3D tank and chest shapes, and measurements in a saline tank. Results show that the traditional (and still most common) adjacent stimulation and measurement patterns have by far the poorest performance (by 6.9 ×). Good results are obtained for trigonometric patterns and for pair drive and measurement patterns separated by over 90°. Since the possible improvement over adjacent patterns is so large, we present this result as a call to action: adjacent patterns are harmful, and should be abandoned. We recommend using pair drive and measurement patterns separated by one electrode less than 180°. We describe an approach to modify an adjacent pattern EIT system by adjusting electrode placement.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Computed tomography of the lung has shown that ventilation shifts from dependent to nondependent lung regions. In this study, we investigated whether, at the bedside, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) at the cranial and caudal thoracic levels can be used to visualize changes in ventilation distribution during a decremental positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) trial and the relation of these changes to global compliance in mechanically ventilated patients.

METHODS: Ventilation distribution was calculated on the basis of EIT results from 12 mechanically ventilated patients after cardiac surgery at a cardiothoracic ICU. Measurements were taken at four PEEP levels (15, 10, 5 and 0 cm H2O) at both the cranial and caudal lung levels, which were divided into four ventral-to-dorsal regions. Regional compliance was calculated using impedance and driving pressure data.

RESULTS: We found that tidal impedance variation divided by tidal volume significantly decreased on caudal EIT slices, whereas this measurement increased on the cranial EIT slices. The dorsal-to-ventral impedance distribution, expressed according to the center of gravity index, decreased during the decremental PEEP trial at both EIT levels. Optimal regional compliance differed at different PEEP levels: 10 and 5 cm H2O at the cranial level and 15 and 10 cm H2O at the caudal level for the dependent and nondependent lung regions, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: At the bedside, EIT measured at two thoracic levels showed different behavior between the caudal and cranial lung levels during a decremental PEEP trial. These results indicate that there is probably no single optimal PEEP level for all lung regions.},

abstract = {EIDORS is an open source software suite for image reconstruction in electrical impedance tomography and diffuse optical tomography, designed to facilitate collaboration, testing and new research in these fields. This paper describes recent work to redesign the software structure in order to simplify its use and provide a uniform interface, permitting easier modification and customization. We describe the key features of this software, followed by examples of its use. One general issue with inverse problem software is the difficulty of correctly implementing algorithms and the consequent ease with which subtle numerical bugs can be inadvertently introduced. EIDORS helps with this issue, by allowing sharing and reuse of well-documented and debugged software. On the other hand, since EIDORS is designed to facilitate use by non-specialists, its use may inadvertently result in such numerical errors. In order to address this issue, we develop a list of ways in which such errors with inverse problems (which we refer to as 'cheats') may occur. Our hope is that such an overview may assist authors of software to avoid such implementation issues.},

abstract = {Inter-subject variability has caused the majority of previous electrical impedance tomography (EIT) techniques to focus on the derivation of relative or difference measures of in vivo tissue resistivity. Implicit in these techniques is the requirement for a reference or previously defined data set. This study assesses the accuracy and optimum electrode placement strategy for a recently developed method which estimates an absolute value of organ resistivity without recourse to a reference data set. Since this measurement of tissue resistivity is absolute, in Ohm metres, it should be possible to use EIT measurements for the objective diagnosis of lung diseases such as pulmonary oedema and emphysema. However, the stability and reproducibility of the method have not yet been investigated fully. To investigate these problems, this study used a Sheffield Mk3.5 system which was configured to operate with eight measurement electrodes. As a result of this study, the absolute resistivity measurement was found to be insensitive to the electrode level between 4 and 5 cm above the xiphoid process. The level of the electrode plane was varied between 2 cm and 7 cm above the xiphoid process. Absolute lung resistivity in 18 normal subjects (age 22.6 +/- 4.9, height 169.1 +/- 5.7 cm, weight 60.6 +/- 4.5 kg, body mass index 21.2 +/- 1.6: mean +/- standard deviation) was measured during both normal and deep breathing for 1 min. Three sets of measurements were made over a period of several days on each of nine of the normal male subjects. No significant differences in absolute lung resistivity were found, either during normal tidal breathing between the electrode levels of 4 and 5 cm (9.3 +/- 2.4 Omega m, 9.6 +/- 1.9 Omega m at 4 and 5 cm, respectively: mean +/- standard deviation) or during deep breathing between the electrode levels of 4 and 5 cm (10.9 +/- 2.9 Omega m and 11.1 +/- 2.3 Omega m, respectively: mean +/- standard deviation). However, the differences in absolute lung resistivity between normal and deep tidal breathing at the same electrode level are significant. No significant difference was found in the coefficient of variation between the electrode levels of 4 and 5 cm (9.5 +/- 3.6\%, 8.5 +/- 3.2\% at 4 and 5 cm, respectively: mean +/- standard deviation in individual subjects). Therefore, the electrode levels of 4 and 5 cm above the xiphoid process showed reasonable reliability in the measurement of absolute lung resistivity both among individuals and over time.},

The first group consisted of 22 patients with clinical diagnosis of lung cancer with tumour localization in one lung. The second group consisted of seven healthy subjects. A patient after a one-sided pneumectomy and another with one-sided emphysema diagnosis were also examined. Static EIT images of a healthy human chest and a chest with various abnormalities are given and discussed. The evaluated system distinguishably visualizes various states of lungs and thorax including lung cancer. The average static conductivity of an affected lung in the first clinical group statistically differs from the average conductivity of a healthy lung. In spite of low spatial resolution, according to preliminary results, the method can be sensitive to cancer and other lung diseases in screening investigations.},

@article{Nehmeh2003,
abstract = {This study proposes a new method to reduce respiratory motion artifacts in PET images of lung cancer. The method is referred to as respiratory-correlated dynamic PET (RCDPET). RCDPET enables the acquisition of 4-dimensional PET data without the need for a respiratory tracking device. In this article, we compare this method with respiratory-gated PET (RGPET). Both methods provide the ability to correct for motion artifacts and more accurately quantitate radiotracer uptake within lung lesions. Both methods were evaluated in phantom studies and 1 patient. METHODS: With RCDPET, data are acquired in consecutive 1-s time frames. A point source attached to a rigid foam block is set on the patient's abdomen and is extended into the camera field of view at the level of the lesion by means of a low-density rod. The position of this source is used to track respiratory motion through the consecutive dynamic frames. Image frames corresponding to a user-selected lesion position within the breathing cycle, in correlation with the point source position, are then identified after scanning. The sinograms of the selected image frames are summed and then reconstructed using iterative reconstruction with segmented attenuation correction. RESULTS: The results from phantom studies with both RGPET and RCDPET were within 10\% agreement, for both activity quantitation and image noise levels. In a clinical application, the quantitation of the SUV(max) and the lesion's size showed a 6\% and 2\% difference, respectively, between RCDPET and RGPET measurements. CONCLUSION: RCDPET can be considered as a comparable, or alternative, method to RGPET in reducing the smearing effects due to respiration and improving quantitation of PET in the thorax. One advantage of RCDPET over RGPET is the ability to retrospectively reconstruct the PET data at any phase or amplitude in the breathing cycle.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT), which can assess regional lung ventilation at the bedside, has never been compared with positron-emission tomography (PET), a gold-standard to quantify regional ventilation. This experiment systematically compared both techniques in injured and non-injured lungs. METHODS: The study was performed in six mechanically ventilated female piglets. In normal lungs, tidal volume (VT) was randomly changed to 6, 8, 10 and 15 ml/kg on zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP), then, at VT 10 ml/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was randomly changed to 5, 10 and 15 cmH2O. Afterwards, acute lung injury (ALI) was subsequently created in three animals by injecting 3 ml/kg hydrochloric acid into the trachea. Then at PEEP 5 cmH2O, VT was randomly changed to 8 and 12 ml/kg and PEEP of 10 and 15 cmH2O applied at VT 10 ml/kg. EIT and PET examinations were performed simultaneously. EIT ventilation (VTEIT) and lung volume (VL) were measured in the anterior and posterior area of each lung. On the same regions of interest, ventilation (VPET) and aerated lung volume (VAatten) were determined with PET. RESULTS: On ZEEP, VTEIT and VPET significantly correlated for global (VTEIT = VPET - 2E-13, R2 = 0.95, P < 0.001) and regional (VTEIT = 0.81VPET+7.65, R2 = 0.63, P < 0.001) ventilation over both conditions. For ALI condition, corresponding R2 were 0.91 and 0.73 (P < 0.01). Bias was = 0 and limits of agreement were -37.42 and +37.42 ml/min for global ventilation over both conditions. These values were 0.04 and -29.01 and +29.08 ml/min, respectively, for regional ventilation. Significant correlations were also found between VL and VAatten for global (VL = VAatten+1E-12, R2 = 0.93, P < 0.0001) and regional (VL = 0.99VAatten+0.92, R2 = 0.65, P < 0.001) volume. For ALI condition, corresponding R2 were 0.94 (P < 0.001) and 0.54 (P < 0.05). Bias was = 0 and limits of agreement ranged -38.16 and +38.16 ml for global ventilation over both conditions. These values were -0.24 and -31.96 to +31.48 ml, respectively, for regional ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Regional lung ventilation and volume were accurately measured with EIT in healthy and injured lungs and validated by simultaneous PET imaging.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a non-invasive method for quantification of blood and pigment distributions across the posterior pole of the fundus from multispectral images using a computer-generated reflectance model of the fundus. METHODS: A computer model was developed to simulate light interaction with the fundus at different wavelengths. The distribution of macular pigment (MP) and retinal haemoglobins in the fundus was obtained by comparing the model predictions with multispectral image data at each pixel. Fundus images were acquired from 16 healthy subjects from various ethnic backgrounds and parametric maps showing the distribution of MP and of retinal haemoglobins throughout the posterior pole were computed. RESULTS: The relative distributions of MP and retinal haemoglobins in the subjects were successfully derived from multispectral images acquired at wavelengths 507, 525, 552, 585, 596, and 611 nm, providing certain conditions were met and eye movement between exposures was minimal. Recovery of other fundus pigments was not feasible and further development of the imaging technique and refinement of the software are necessary to understand the full potential of multispectral retinal image analysis. CONCLUSION: The distributions of MP and retinal haemoglobins obtained in this preliminary investigation are in good agreement with published data on normal subjects. The ongoing development of the imaging system should allow for absolute parameter values to be computed. A further study will investigate subjects with known pathologies to determine the effectiveness of the method as a screening and diagnostic tool.},

abstract = {Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a noninvasive, quantitative method to assess pulmonary perfusion and ventilation in vivo. The core of this article focuses on the use of [13N]nitrogen (13N2) and PET to assess regional gas exchange. Regional perfusion and shunt can be measured with the 13N2-saline bolus infusion technique. A bolus of 13N2, dissolved in saline solution, is injected intravenously at the start of a brief apnea, while the tracer kinetics in the lung is measured by a sequence of PET frames. Because of its low solubility in blood, virtually all 13N2 delivered to aerated lung regions diffuses into the alveolar airspace, where it accumulates in proportion to regional perfusion during the apnea. In contrast, lung regions that are perfused but are not aerated and do not exchange gas (i.e., "shunting" units) do not retain 13N2 during apnea and the tracer concentration drops after the initial peak. Accurate estimates of regional perfusion and regional shunt can be derived by applying a mathematical model to the pulmonary kinetics of a 13N2-saline bolus. When breathing is resumed, specific alveolar ventilation can be calculated from the tracer washout rate, because 13N2 is eliminated almost exclusively by ventilation. Because of the rapid elimination of the tracer, 13N2 infusion scans can be followed by 13N2 inhalation scans that allow determination of regional gas fraction. This article describes insights into the pathophysiology of acute lung injury, pulmonary embolism, and asthma that have been gained by PET imaging of regional gas exchange.},

abstract = {The digital camera is a powerful tool to capture images for use in image processing and colour communication. However, the RGB signals generated by a digital camera are device-dependent, i.e., different digital cameras produce different RGB responses for the same scene. Furthermore, they are not colorimetric, i.e., the output RGB signals do not directly correspond to the device-independent tristimulus values based on the CIE standard colorimetric observer. One approach for deriving a colorimetric mapping between camera RGB signals and CIE tristimulus values uses polynomial modeling and is described here. The least squares fitting technique was used to derive the coefficients of 3 × n polynomial transfer matrices, yielding a modeling accuracy typically averaging 1 $\Delta$E units in CMC(1:1) when a 3 × 11 matrix is used. Experiments were carried out to investigate the repeatability of the digitizing system, characterization performance when different polynomials were used, modeling accuracy when 8-bit and 12-bit RGB data were used for characterization, and the number of reference samples needed to achieve a reasonable degree of modeling accuracy. Choice of characterization target and media and their effect on metamerism have been examined. It is demonstrated that a model is dependent upon both media and colorant, and applying a model to other media/colorants can lead to serious eye–camera metamerism problems. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

A basal CT section (just above the diaphragm) was obtained in the supine position at zero cm H2O end-expiratory pressure. In each CT section the distance from ventral to dorsal surface (hT) was divided into 10 equal intervals, and 10 lung levels from ventral (no. 1) to dorsal (no. 10) were defined. Knowing the average density and the volume of each level, we computed: (1) the tissue volume; (2) the gas/tissue (g/t) ratio (index of regional inflation); (3) the hydrostatic pressure superimposed on each level (SPL), estimated as density x height. The total volume of the basal CT section was 49 +/- 2.5 ml x m-2 (mean +/- SE) in control subjects and 43 +/- 2.3 ml x m-2 in patients with ARDS (p = not significant [NS]). The tissue volume, however, was 16.7 +/- 0.8 ml x m-2 in control subjects and 31.6 +/- 1.7 ml x m-2 in patients with ARDS (p < 0.01). The g/t ratio in level 1 averaged 4.7 +/- 0.5 in control subjects and 1.2 +/- 0.2 in patients with ARDS (p < 0.01), and this ratio decreased exponentially from level 1 to level 10, both in controls and patients with ARDS.

abstract = {PET-CT scanners allow generation of transmission maps from CT. The use of CT attenuation correction (CTAC) instead of germanium-68 attenuation correction (Ge AC) might be expected to cause artifacts on reconstructed emission images if differences in respiratory status exist between the two methods of attenuation correction. The aim of this study was to evaluate for possible respiratory motion artifacts (RMA) in PET images attenuation corrected with CT from PET-CT in clinical patients. PET-CT scans were performed using a Discovery LS PET-CT system in 50 consecutive patients (23 males, 27 females; mean age 58.2 years) with known or suspected malignancy. Both CTAC and Ge AC transmission data obtained during free tidal breathing were used to correct PET emission images. Cold artifacts at the interface of the lungs and diaphragm, believed to be due to respiratory motion (RMA), that were seen on CTAC images but not on the Ge AC images were evaluated qualitatively on a four-point scale (0, no artifact; 1, mild artifact; 2, moderate artifact; 3, severe artifact). RMA was also measured for height. Curvilinear cold artifacts paralleling the dome of the diaphragm at the lung/diaphragm interface were noted on 84\% of PET-CT image acquisitions and were not seen on the (68)Ge-corrected images; however, these artifacts were infrequently severe. In conclusion, RMA of varying magnitude were noted in most of our patients as a curvilinear cold area at the lung/diaphragm interface, but were not diagnostically problematic in these patients.},

abstract = {Imbalances in regional lung ventilation, with gravity-dependent collapse and overdistention of nondependent zones, are likely associated to ventilator-induced lung injury. Electric impedance tomography is a new imaging technique that is potentially capable of monitoring those imbalances. The aim of this study was to validate electrical impedance tomography measurements of ventilation distribution, by comparison with dynamic computerized tomography in a heterogeneous population of critically ill patients under mechanical ventilation. Multiple scans with both devices were collected during slow-inflation breaths. Six repeated breaths were monitored by impedance tomography, showing acceptable reproducibility. We observed acceptable agreement between both technologies in detecting right-left ventilation imbalances (bias = 0\% and limits of agreement = -10 to +10\%). Relative distribution of ventilation into regions or layers representing one-fourth of the thoracic section could also be assessed with good precision. Depending on electrode positioning, impedance tomography slightly overestimated ventilation imbalances along gravitational axis. Ventilation was gravitationally dependent in all patients, with some transient blockages in dependent regions synchronously detected by both scanning techniques. Among variables derived from computerized tomography, changes in absolute air content best explained the integral of impedance changes inside regions of interest (r(2) > or = 0.92). Impedance tomography can reliably assess ventilation distribution during mechanical ventilation.},

abstract = {The instantaneous noise-free linear mixing model in independent component analysis is largely a solved problem under the usual assumption of independent nongaussian sources and full column rank mixing matrix. However, with some prior information on the sources, like positivity, new analysis and perhaps simplified solution methods may yet become possible. In this letter, we consider the task of independent component analysis when the independent sources are known to be nonnegative and well grounded, which means that they have a nonzero pdf in the region of zero. It can be shown that in this case, the solution method is basically very simple: an orthogonal rotation of the whitened observation vector into nonnegative outputs will give a positive permutation of the original sources. We propose a cost function whose minimum coincides with nonnegativity and derive the gradient algorithm under the whitening constraint, under which the separating matrix is orthogonal. We further prove that in the Stiefel manifold of orthogonal matrices, the cost function is a Lyapunov function for the matrix gradient flow, implying global convergence. Thus, this algorithm is guaranteed to find the nonnegative well-grounded independent sources. The analysis is complemented by a numerical simulation, which illustrates the algorithm.},

Reconstruction of the conductivity distribution is an under-determined and ill-posed problem, typically requiring either simplifying assumptions or regularization based on a priori knowledge. This paper presents a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach to linearized image reconstruction using knowledge of the noise variance of the measurements and the covariance of the conductivity distribution. This approach has the advantage of an intuitive interpretation of the algorithm parameters as well as fast (near real time) image reconstruction. In order to compare this approach to existing algorithms, the authors develop figures of merit to measure the reconstructed image resolution, the noise amplification of the image reconstruction, and the fidelity of positioning in the image. Finally, the authors develop a communications systems approach to calculate the probability of detection of a conductivity contrast in the reconstructed image as a function of the measurement noise and the reconstruction algorithm used.},

abstract = {The electric properties (EPs) of biological tissue, i.e., the electric conductivity and permittivity, can provide important information in the diagnosis of various diseases. The EPs also play an important role in specific absorption rate calculation, a major concern in high-field MRI, as well as in nonmedical areas such as wireless telecommunications. The high-field MRI system is accompanied by significant wave propagation effects, and the RF radiation is dependent on the EPs of biological tissue. On the basis of the measurement of the active transverse magnetic component of the applied RF field (known as B(1)-mapping technique), we propose a dual-excitation algorithm, which uses two sets of measured B(1) data to noninvasively reconstruct the EPs of biological tissues. The finite-element method was utilized in 3-D modeling and B(1) field calculation. A series of computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method on a 3-D head model within a TEM coil and a birdcage coil. Using a TEM coil, when noise free, the reconstructed EP distribution of tissues in the brain has relative errors of 12\%-28\% and correlated coefficients of greater than 0.91. Compared with other B(1)-mapping-based reconstruction algorithms, our approach provides superior performance without the need for iterative computations. The present simulation results suggest that good reconstruction of EPs from B1 mapping can be achieved.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is very sensitive to deformations of the medium boundary shape. For lung imaging, breathing and changes in posture move the electrodes and change the chest shape, resulting in image artefacts. Several approaches have been proposed to improve the reconstructed images; most methods reconstruct both the boundary deformation and conductivity change from the measured data. These techniques require the calculation of the 'movement Jacobian', reflecting measurement changes due to the boundary deformation. Previous papers have calculated this Jacobian using perturbation techniques, which are slow (requiring multiple solutions of the forward problem) and become inaccurate with increasing finite element model size. This effect has limited reconstruction algorithms for deformable media to mostly 2D. To address this problem, we propose a direct method to calculate the Jacobian, based on a formulation of the derivatives of the finite element system matrix with respect to geometry changes. An illustrative example of these calculations is given, as well as a comparison between the proposed method and a perturbation method. Results show this method is approximately 300 times faster; and for larger model sizes, the perturbation method begins to diverge from those from the direct method proposed.},

DESIGN: Prospective observational clinical study. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS: Eleven non-muscle relaxed preterm infants with RDS ventilated with open lung high-frequency ventilation (HFV). INTERVENTIONS: Closed ETT suction. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Changes in global and regional lung volume were measured with electrical impedance tomography. ETT suction resulted in an acute loss of lung volume followed by spontaneous recovery with a median residual loss of 3.3\% of the maximum volume loss. The median stabilization time was 8 s. At the regional level, the lung volume changes during and after ETT suction were heterogeneous in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Closed ETT suction causes an acute, transient and heterogeneous loss of lung volume in premature infants with RDS treated with open lung HFV.},

In this paper is presented the realization of a 2D realistic thoracic model as a better approach compared to circular meshing.

By comparing the different discretizations it is possible to choose an appropriate mesh density for the 2D EIT problem.},

The purpose of this work was to develop a method for application of low frequency currents to the scalp, which delivered the maximum current without significant stimulation of skin or underlying brain. We propose a recessed electrode design which enabled current injection with an acceptable skin sensation to be increased from 100 muA using EEG electrodes, to 1 mA in 16 normal volunteers. The effect of current delivered to the brain was assessed with an anatomically realistic finite element model of the adult head. The modelled peak cerebral current density was 0.3 A/m(2), which was 5 to 25-fold less than the threshold for stimulation of the brain estimated from literature review.},

The injection current generates a magnetic field that we can measure from MR phase images. We obtain internal current density images from the measured magnetic flux densities via Ampere's law. However, we must rotate the subject to acquire all of the three components of the induced magnetic flux density. This subject rotation is impractical in clinical MRI scanners when the subject is a human body. In this paper, we propose a way to eliminate the requirement of subject rotation by careful mathematical analysis of the MRCDI problem. In our new MRCDI technique, we need to measure only one component of the induced magnetic flux density and reconstruct both cross-sectional conductivity and current density images without any subject rotation.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an attractive method of monitoring patients during mechanical ventilation because it can provide a noninvasive continuous image of pulmonary impedance, which indicates the distribution of ventilation. This article will discuss ongoing research on EIT, with a focus on methodological aspects and limitations and novel approaches in terms of pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapeutic advancements. RECENT FINDINGS: EIT enables the detection of regional distribution of alveolar ventilation and, thus, the quantification of local inhomogeneities in lung mechanics. By detecting recruitment and derecruitment, a positive end-expiratory pressure level at which tidal ventilation is relatively homogeneous in all lung regions can be defined. Additionally, different approaches to characterize the temporal local behaviour of lung tissue during ventilation have been proposed, which adds important information. SUMMARY: There is growing evidence that supports EIT usage as a bedside measure to individually optimize ventilator settings in critically ill patients in order to prevent ventilator-induced lung injury. A standardization of current approaches to analyse and interpret EIT data is required in order to facilitate the clinical implementation.},

abstract = {We have adapted a SENSE-accelerated imaging technique to magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) in order to acquire data faster or improve spatial resolution without increasing the data acquisition time. We also designed and optimized an eight-channel, dedicated phased array coil for this application. The RF coil was designed as two planar arrays so that the open sides could accommodate the MREIT electrodes. A quasi-intrinsic decoupling scheme was used to minimize couplings between coil elements, and a restricted geometry optimization was applied to achieve high and uniform SNR within a given coil geometry and animal size. The impact of variability in the size of animals was also investigated in the optimization. This coil geometry provided approximately three times higher SNR at the center of a phantom when compared to a transmit/receive birdcage coil designed for MREIT of small animals. Therefore, the SNR was superior to the data acquired with volume coils even with three times SENSE acceleration. Both magnitude images and MREIT data were acquired from phantoms with and without SENSE acceleration, and the results were compared. The phantom studies demonstrated that conductivity maps can be reconstructed from MREIT data acquired with three times SENSE acceleration and that no discernible artifacts were observed when accelerated data acquisition was compared to non-accelerated data.},

abstract = {Management of metastatic disease is integral to cancer treatment. Evaluation of metastases often requires surgical removal of all anatomically susceptible lymph nodes for ex vivo pathologic examination. We report a family of novel ratiometric activatable cell-penetrating peptides, which contain Cy5 as far red fluorescent donor and Cy7 as near-infrared fluorescent acceptor. Cy5 is quenched in favor of Cy7 re-emission until the intervening linker is cut by tumor-associated matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 (MMP2,9) or elastases. Such cleavage increases the Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio 40-fold and triggers tissue retention of the Cy5-containing fragment. This ratiometric increase provides an accelerated and quantifiable metric to identify primary tumors and metastases to liver and lymph nodes with increased sensitivity and specificity. This technique represents a significant advance over existing nonratiometric protease sensors and sentinel lymph node detection methods, which give no information about cancer invasion.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to validate the ability of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to detect local changes in air content, resulting from modified ventilator settings, by comparing EIT findings with electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) scans obtained under identical steady-state conditions. The experiments were carried out on six anesthetized supine pigs ventilated with five tidal volumes (VT) at three positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels. The lung air content changes were determined both by EIT (Goe-MF1 system) and EBCT (Imatron C-150XP scanner) in six regions of interest, located in the ventral, middle, and dorsal areas of each lung, with respect to the reference air content at the lowest VT and PEEP, as a change in either local electrical impedance or lung tissue density. An increase in local air content with VT and PEEP was identified by both methods at all regions studied. A good correlation between the changes in lung air content determined by EIT and EBCT was revealed. Mean correlation coefficients in the ventral, middle, and dorsal regions were 0.81, 0.87, and 0.93, respectively. The study confirms that EIT is a suitable, noninvasive method for detecting regional changes in air content and monitoring local effects of artificial ventilation.},

We have showed the feasibility of this method through computer simulations and human experiments. We speculate that the EIT imaging technique will be more reliable than the current impedance apnea monitoring method, since we are monitoring the change of internal lung resistivity. However, more study is required to verify that this method performs better in the presence of motion artifact than the conventional two-electrode impedance apnea monitoring method.

RECENT FINDINGS: Whereas former investigations addressed the issue of validating EIT to measure regional ventilation, current studies focus on clinical applications such as detection of pneumothorax. Furthermore, EIT has been used to quantify lung collapse and tidal recruitment in order to titrate positive end-expiratory pressure. Indicator-free EIT measurements might be sufficient for the continuous measurement of cardiac stroke volume, but assessment of regional lung perfusion presumably requires the use of a contrast agent such as hypertonic saline.

abstract = {Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) aims at producing high-resolution cross-sectional conductivity images of an electrically conducting object such as the human body. Following numerous phantom imaging experiments, the most recent study demonstrated successful conductivity image reconstructions of postmortem canine brains using a 3 T MREIT system with 40 mA imaging currents. Here, we report the results of in vivo animal imaging experiments using 5 mA imaging currents. To investigate any change of electrical conductivity due to brain ischemia, canine brains having a regional ischemic model were scanned along with separate scans of canine brains having no disease model. Reconstructed multi-slice conductivity images of in vivo canine brains with a pixel size of 1.4 mm showed a clear contrast between white and gray matter and also between normal and ischemic regions. We found that the conductivity value of an ischemic region decreased by about 10-14\%. In a postmortem brain, conductivity values of white and gray matter decreased by about 4-8\% compared to those in a live brain. Accumulating more experience of in vivo animal imaging experiments, we plan to move to human experiments. One of the important goals of our future work is the reduction of the imaging current to a level that a human subject can tolerate. The ability to acquire high-resolution conductivity images will find numerous clinical applications not supported by other medical imaging modalities. Potential applications in biology, chemistry and material science are also expected.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) estimates an image of conductivity change within a body from stimulation and measurement at body surface electrodes. There is significant interest in EIT for imaging the thorax, as a monitoring tool for lung ventilation. To be useful in this application, we require an understanding of if and when EIT images can produce inaccurate images. In this paper, we study the consequences of the homogeneous background assumption, frequently made in linear image reconstruction, which introduces a mismatch between the reference measurement and the linearization point. We show in simulation and experimental data that the resulting images may contain large and clinically significant errors. A 3D finite element model of thorax conductivity is used to simulate EIT measurements for different heart and lung conductivity, size and position, as well as different amounts of gravitational collapse and ventilation-associated conductivity change. Three common linear EIT reconstruction algorithms are studied. We find that the asymmetric position of the heart can cause EIT images of ventilation to show up to 60\% undue bias towards the left lung and that the effect is particularly strong for a ventilation distribution typical of mechanically ventilated patients. The conductivity gradient associated with gravitational lung collapse causes conductivity changes in non-dependent lung to be overestimated by up to 100\% with respect to the dependent lung. Eliminating the mismatch by using a realistic conductivity distribution in the forward model of the reconstruction algorithm strongly reduces these undesirable effects. We conclude that subject-specific anatomically accurate forward models should be used in lung EIT and extra care is required when analysing EIT images of subjects whose background conductivity distribution in the lungs is known to be heterogeneous or exhibiting large changes.},

abstract = {We assessed in eight dogs the accuracy with which electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can monitor changes in lung volume by comparing the changes in mean lung conductivity obtained with EIT to changes in esophageal pressure (Pes) and to airway opening pressure (Pao) measured after airway occlusion. The average volume measurement errors were determined: 26 ml for EIT; 35 ml for Pao; and 54 ml for Pes. Subsequently, lung inflation due to applied positive end-expiratory pressure was measured by EIT (delta VEIT) and Pao (delta VPAO) under both inflation and deflation conditions. Whereas delta VPAO was equal under both conditions, delta VEIT was 28 ml greater during deflation than inflation, indicating that EIT is sensitive to lung volume history. The average inflation delta VEIT was 67.7 +/- 78 ml greater than delta VPAO, for an average volume increase of 418 ml. Lung inflation due to external expiratory resistance was measured during ventilation by EIT (delta VEIT,vent) and Pes (delta VPes,vent) and at occlusion by EIT (delta VEIT,occl), Pes, and Pao. The average differences between EIT estimates and delta VEIT,occl were 5.8 +/- 44 ml for delta VEIT,vent and 49.5 +/- 34 ml for delta VEIT,occl. The average volume increase for all dogs was 442.2 ml. These results show that EIT can provide usefully accurate estimates of changes in lung volume over an extended time period and that the technique has promise as a means of conveniently and noninvasively monitoring lung hyperinflation.},

abstract = {Regional lung overdistension occurring during high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) and partial liquid ventilation (PLV) was investigated in a prospective animal trial using 18 mechanically ventilated Yorkshire swine under general anesthesia. Lung injury was induced with saline lavage and augmented using large tidal volumes. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and regional lung histopathology were used to identify regional lung overdistension during HFOV. Lung injury was quantified using a histopathologic lung injury score. The animals were randomized to three groups (n = 6 animals in each group): a control group and two dose groups of perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) (PFOB-Lo 1.5 ml kg(-1) and PFOB-Hi 3 ml kg(-1)). The animals were transitioned from conventional ventilation to HFOV, and a slow inflation-deflation maneuver was performed by changing mean airway pressure (Paw) by 5 cmH(2)O every 15 min to a maximum Paw of 40 cmH(2)O. In dependent lung areas, the PFOB-Hi (3 ml kg(-1)) group, in comparison with the control group, was associated with significantly greater alveolar overdistension seen on lung histopathology (P < 0.001 compared to control), a decreased mean impedance (P < 0.05 compared to the control group) and a decreased ventilation-induced impedance change during HFOV (P < 0.05 compared to the control group). We conclude that treatment with PFOB-Hi during HFOV compared to a control group in an animal model of lung injury led to regional overdistension of dependent lung areas, as evidenced by increased alveolar overdistension on lung histopathology, decreased mean lung impedance and decreased HFOV-induced regional lung volume changes as measured by EIT.},

Studies of the effect of changes in posture on the calibration of the system show changes of between +9.5\% and -3.8\% in normal male subjects.

The design of the measuring system and image reconstruction software are described. Thirty-one subjects were examined and divided into four clinical groups. The first group consisted of 22 patients with clinical diagnosis of lung cancer with tumour localization in one lung. The second group consisted of seven healthy subjects. A patient after a one-sided pneumectomy and another with one-sided emphysema diagnosis were also examined. Static EIT images of a healthy human chest and a chest with various abnormalities are given and discussed. The evaluated system distinguishably visualizes various states of lungs and thorax including lung cancer. The average static conductivity of an affected lung in the first clinical group statistically differs from the average conductivity of a healthy lung. In spite of low spatial resolution, according to preliminary results, the method can be sensitive to cancer and other lung diseases in screening investigations.},

abstract = {Applied potential tomography (APT) or electrical impedance imaging has received considerable attention during the past few years and some in vivo images have been produced. This paper reviews the current situation in terms of what in vivo results have been and are likely to be obtained in the near future. Both static and dynamic imaging are possible and these two areas are dealt with separately. Features of the existing in vivo imaging system are good tissue contrast, high-speed data collection, good sensitivity to resistivity changes, low spatial resolution, low cost and no known hazard. It is concluded that the most promising way forward to clinical application in the short term is to use dynamic as opposed to static imaging. An example of lung imaging is shown and the application to measuring regional ventilation and pulmonary oedema is discussed. Use of APT for the detection of intraventricular bleeding in neonates is discussed as is the proven ability to study gastric physiology by imaging resistivity distribution changes following the ingestion of conducting or insulating fluids. Other areas of possible application which are considered are blood flow measurement, cell counting, measurement of lean-fat ratios and the detection of soft tissue lesions.},

abstract = {Respiratory motion may reduce the sensitivity of (18)F-FDG PET for the detection of small pulmonary nodules close to the base of the lungs. This motion also interferes with attempts to use fused PET/CT images through software or combined PET/CT devices. This study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of respiratory gating for PET of the chest and the impact of respiratory motion on quantitative analysis. METHODS: Ten healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Three-dimensional studies were acquired with 8 gates per respiratory cycle on a commercial PET scanner with a temperature-sensitive respiratory gating device built in-house. All scans were obtained over 42 cm of body length with 3 bed positions of 10 min each after injection of (18)F-FDG at 4.5 MBq/kg. The reconstructed images were assembled to produce gated whole-body volumes and maximum-intensity projections. The amplitude of respiratory motion of the kidneys (as a surrogate for diaphragmatic incursion) as well as the apex of the heart was measured in the coronal plane. Phantom studies were acquired to simulate the impact of respiratory motion on quantitative uptake measurements. RESULTS: The respiratory gating device produced a consistent, reliable trigger signal. All acquisitions were successful and produced reconstructed volumes with excellent image quality. Mean +/- SD motion amplitude and maximal motion amplitude values were 6.7 +/- 3.0 and 11.9 mm for the heart, 12.0 +/- 3.7 and 18.8 mm for the right kidney, and 11.1 +/- 4.8 and 17.1 mm for the left kidney, respectively. In phantom studies, the standardized uptake value for a 1-mL lesion was underestimated by 30\% and 48\% for the average and maximal respiratory motion values, respectively. CONCLUSION: Respiratory gating of PET of the thorax and upper abdomen is a practical and feasible approach that may improve the detection of small pulmonary nodules. Further work is planned to assess prospectively the diagnostic accuracy of this new method.},

Utilizing a recently developed model of (13)N tracer kinetics (3), we evaluated changes in ventilation, perfusion, shunt, and regional gas content in nondependent, middle, and dependent lung zones. The data demonstrated a progressive development of regional shunt in dependent (dorsal) regions in which perfusion remained the highest throughout the study. These findings, together with decreasing regional ventilation and fractional gas content in the dependent regions, correlated with decreasing arterial Pa(O(2)) values over the course of the study. A negative correlation between regional shunt fraction and regional gas content in dependent and middle regions suggests that shunt was caused by progressive alveolar derecruitment or flooding.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown the ability of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) to assess regional ventilation distribution in human lungs. Fluid accumulation in the pleural space as in empyema, typically occurring on one chest side, may influence the distribution of ventilation and the corresponding EIT findings. The aim of our study was to examine this effect on the assessment of regional ventilation by EIT. Six patients suffering from unilateral empyema and intubated with a double-lumen endotracheal tube were studied. EIT data were acquired during volume-controlled ventilation with bilateral (tidal volume (V(T)): 800 ml) and unilateral ventilation (V(T): 400 ml) of the right and left lungs. Mean tidal amplitudes of the EIT signal were calculated in all image pixels. The sums of these values, expressed as relative impedance change (rel. $\Delta$Z), were then determined in whole images and functionally defined regions-of-interest (ROI). The sums of rel. $\Delta$Z calculated during the two cases of one-lung ventilation either on the affected or unaffected side were significantly smaller than during bilateral ventilation. However, in contrast to previous findings in patients with no pleural pathology, very low values of rel. $\Delta$Z were found when the lung on the affected side was ventilated. ROI-based analysis rendered higher values than the whole-image analysis in this case, nonetheless, the values were significantly smaller than when the unaffected side was ventilated in spite of identical VT. In conclusion, our results indicate that the presence of empyema may affect the quantitative evaluation of regional lung ventilation by EIT.},

abstract = {Ten patients with parenchymal acute respiratory failure (ARF) underwent computed tomography (CT) scans while in the supine and prone positions. At equal levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, the authors measured the changes of CT density in dorsal and ventral basilar lung regions induced by the change of position as well as alterations of gas exchange. The level of venous admixture did not change with body position. The CT scan image of each lung was fractionated into ten levels from dorsal to ventral, each constituting 10\% of the lung height. After measuring each lung fraction, the volume, the average CT number, its frequency distribution, and the expected normal value, we computed the lung tissue mass, the excess tissue mass, and the fraction of normally inflated tissue (excess tissue mass = amount of "tissue," which includes edema, cells, and blood in excess of the expected normal value). We also estimated the superimposed hydrostatic pressure on each lung region. We found that the excess lung tissue mass is independent of position. However, in patients in the supine position, lung CT density increased and regional inflation decreased from ventral to dorsal, suggesting progressive deflation of gas-containing alveoli along the gravity gradient. A similar ventral-dorsal deflation pattern occurred within 10 min in patients in the prone position. We conclude that the lung in patients with ARF behaves like an elastic body with a diffusely increased mass; dependent lung regions are compressed by the pressure of overlying structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Computed tomography of the lung has shown that ventilation shifts from dependent to nondependent lung regions. In this study, we investigated whether, at the bedside, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) at the cranial and caudal thoracic levels can be used to visualize changes in ventilation distribution during a decremental positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) trial and the relation of these changes to global compliance in mechanically ventilated patients.

METHODS: Ventilation distribution was calculated on the basis of EIT results from 12 mechanically ventilated patients after cardiac surgery at a cardiothoracic ICU. Measurements were taken at four PEEP levels (15, 10, 5 and 0 cm H2O) at both the cranial and caudal lung levels, which were divided into four ventral-to-dorsal regions. Regional compliance was calculated using impedance and driving pressure data.

RESULTS: We found that tidal impedance variation divided by tidal volume significantly decreased on caudal EIT slices, whereas this measurement increased on the cranial EIT slices. The dorsal-to-ventral impedance distribution, expressed according to the center of gravity index, decreased during the decremental PEEP trial at both EIT levels. Optimal regional compliance differed at different PEEP levels: 10 and 5 cm H2O at the cranial level and 15 and 10 cm H2O at the caudal level for the dependent and nondependent lung regions, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: At the bedside, EIT measured at two thoracic levels showed different behavior between the caudal and cranial lung levels during a decremental PEEP trial. These results indicate that there is probably no single optimal PEEP level for all lung regions.},

abstract = {Management of metastatic disease is integral to cancer treatment. Evaluation of metastases often requires surgical removal of all anatomically susceptible lymph nodes for ex vivo pathologic examination. We report a family of novel ratiometric activatable cell-penetrating peptides, which contain Cy5 as far red fluorescent donor and Cy7 as near-infrared fluorescent acceptor. Cy5 is quenched in favor of Cy7 re-emission until the intervening linker is cut by tumor-associated matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 (MMP2,9) or elastases. Such cleavage increases the Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio 40-fold and triggers tissue retention of the Cy5-containing fragment. This ratiometric increase provides an accelerated and quantifiable metric to identify primary tumors and metastases to liver and lymph nodes with increased sensitivity and specificity. This technique represents a significant advance over existing nonratiometric protease sensors and sentinel lymph node detection methods, which give no information about cancer invasion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: General anaesthesia impairs the gas exchange in the lungs, and moderate desaturation (SaO2 86-90\%) occurred in 50\% of anaesthetised patients in a blinded pulse oximetry study. A high FiO2 might reduce the risk of hypoxaemia, but can also promote atelectasis. We hypothesised that a moderate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level of 10 cmH2O can prevent atelectasis during ventilation with an FiO2 = 1.0. METHODS: Atelectasis was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) in 13 ASA I-II patients undergoing elective surgery. CT scans were obtained before and 15 min after induction of anaesthesia. Then, recruitment of collapsed lung tissue was performed as a "vital capacity manoeuvre" (VCM, inspiration with Paw = 40 cmH2O for 15 s), and a CT scan was obtained at the end of the VCM. Thereafter, PEEP = 0 cmH2O was applied in group 1, and PEEP = 10 cmH2O in group 2. Additional CT scans were obtained after the VCM. Oxygenation was measured before and after the VCM. RESULTS: Atelectasis (> 1 cm2) was present in 12 of the 13 patients after induction of anaesthesia. At 5 and 10 min after the VCM, atelectasis was significantly smaller in group 2 than group 1 (P < 0.005). A significant inverse correlation was found between PaO2 and atelectasis. CONCLUSIONS: PEEP = 10 cmH2O reduced atelectasis formation after a VCM, when FiO2 = 1.0 was used. Thus, a VCM followed by PEEP = 10 cmH2O should be considered when patients are ventilated with a high FiO2 and gas exchange is impaired.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is a non-invasive technique for imaging the internal conductivity distribution in tissue within an MRI scanner, utilizing the magnetic flux density, which is introduced when a current is injected into the tissue from external electrodes. This magnetic flux alters the MRI signal, so that appropriate reconstruction can provide a map of the additional z-component of the magnetic field (B(z)) as well as the internal current density distribution that created it. To extract the internal electrical properties of the subject, including the conductivity and/or the current density distribution, MREIT techniques use the relationship between the external injection current and the z-component of the magnetic flux density B = (B(x), B(y), B(z)). The tissue studied typically contains defective regions, regions with a low MRI signal and/or low MRI signal-to-noise-ratio, due to the low density of nuclear magnetic resonance spins, short T(2) or T*(2) relaxation times, as well as regions with very low electrical conductivity, through which very little current traverses. These defective regions provide noisy B(z) data, which can severely degrade the overall reconstructed conductivity distribution. Injecting two independent currents through surface electrodes, this paper proposes a new direct method to reconstruct a regional absolute isotropic conductivity distribution in a region of interest (ROI) while avoiding the defective regions. First, the proposed method reconstructs the contrast of conductivity using the transversal J-substitution algorithm, which blocks the propagation of severe accumulated noise from the defective region to the ROI. Second, the proposed method reconstructs the regional projected current density using the relationships between the internal current density, which stems from a current injection on the surface, and the measured B(z) data. Combining the contrast conductivity distribution in the entire imaging slice and the reconstructed regional projected current density, we propose a direct non-iterative algorithm to reconstruct the absolute conductivity in the ROI. The numerical simulations in the presence of various degrees of noise, as well as a phantom MRI imaging experiment showed that the proposed method reconstructs the regional absolute conductivity in a ROI within a subject including the defective regions. In the simulation experiment, the relative L₂-mode errors of the reconstructed regional and global conductivities were 0.79 and 0.43, respectively, using a noise level of 50 db in the defective region.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a lowcost, non-invasive and radiation free medical imaging modality for monitoring ventilation distribution in the lung. Although such information could be invaluable in preventing ventilatorinduced lung injury in mechanically ventilated patients, clinical application of EIT is hindered by difficulties in interpreting the resulting images. One source of this difficulty is the frequent use of simple shapes which do not correspond to the anatomy to reconstruct EIT images. The mismatch between the true body shape and the one used for reconstruction is known to introduce errors, which to date have not been properly characterized. In the present study we therefore seek to 1) characterize and quantify the errors resulting from a reconstruction shape mismatch for a number of popular EIT reconstruction algorithms and 2) develop recommendations on the tolerated amount of mismatch for each algorithm. Using real and simulated data, we analyze the performance of 4 EIT reconstruction algorithms under different degrees of shape mismatch. Results suggest that while slight shape mismatch is well tolerated by all algorithms, using a circular shape severely degrades their performance.},

Clinical symptoms include refractory hypoxemia, noncardiogenic edema, and decreased lung compliance. The purpose of this review is to summarize the different ARDS large-animal models in terms of similarity to the clinical disease and underlying pathophysiology. The repeated lavage, oleic acid, endotoxin, and smoke/burn ARDS models will be discussed in this review. While each model has significant benefits, none is without weaknesses. Thus, the choice of large-animal ARDS model must be carefully considered based upon the study focus and investigative team experience.},

abstract = {Although the modern surgical era is highlighted by multiple technological advances and innovations, one area that has remained constant is the dependence of the surgeon's vision on white-light reflectance. This renders different body tissues in a limited palette of various shades of pink and red, thereby limiting the visual contrast available to the operating surgeon. Healthy tissue, anatomic variations, and diseased states are seen as slight discolorations relative to each other and differences are inherently limited in dynamic range. In the upcoming years, surgery will undergo a paradigm shift with the use of targeted fluorescence imaging probes aimed at augmenting the surgical armamentarium by expanding the "visible" spectrum available to surgeons. Such fluorescent "smart probes" will provide real-time, intraoperative, pseudo-color, high-contrast delineation of both normal and pathologic tissues. Fluorescent surgical molecular guidance promises another major leap forward to improve patient safety and clinical outcomes, and to reduce overall healthcare costs. This review provides an overview of current and future surgical applications of fluorescence imaging in diseased and nondiseased tissues and focus on the innovative fields of image processing and instrumentation.},

In practice few of these assumptions are met, yet the method appears to give sensible and useful images. This paper looks at errors of reconstruction produced by nonideal placement of the electrodes and shows that the reconstruction method is insensitive to such placement errors.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) is a non-invasive method to visualize cross-sectional electrical conductivity and/or current density by measuring a magnetic flux density signal when an electrical current is injected into a subject. In the MREIT system, it is crucial to reduce the scan duration while maintaining spatial resolution and contrast for practical in vivo implementation. The purpose of the study is to optimize the measured magnetic flux density using an interleaved multiple-echo pulse sequence (injected current nonlinear encoding) that acquires each spatial position multiple times, although these pixels vary between echoes in their signal-to-noise ratio due to (a) T*2 decay and (b) the current density passing through the pixel. Using the acquired multiple measured magnetic flux densities, the noise level for the measured magnetic flux density B(z) at each pixel is estimated using the relationship between the intensity of the magnitude and the width of the injected current. We determine an optimal combination of the multiply acquired magnetic flux densities, which optimally reduces the random noise artifacts. We develop a new denoising technique and apply it to a recovered conductivity distribution with a known noise level of the recovered magnetic flux density, which is designed to provide a stable internal conductivity distribution, while sustaining resolution. The proposed method uses three key steps: the first step is optimizing the magnetic flux density by using the multiple-echo magnetic flux densities at each pixel, the second step is estimating the noise level of this optimized magnetic flux density and the third step is applying a denoising technique using the pixel-specific estimated noise level. Numerical simulation experiments using a three-dimensional cylindrical phantom model validated the proposed method. Multiple-echo B(z) data were generated, including in short T*2 or low spin-density regions, as a function of T*2 and the temporal extent of the injected current. In the simulation experiment, comparing between an equally averaged and the optimized B(z) methods, relative L2-mode errors were 0.053 and 0.024, respectively. In an actual imaging experiment of an agarose gel filled with objects of various conductivities and shapes, we acquired six echoes per repetition time. The optimal weighting factors minimized the effects of noise in B(z), and provided reconstructed conductivity maps that suppressed noise artifacts that normally accumulate in the low signal-to-noise-ratio defect regions.},

abstract = {This study evaluated lesion mislocalization between PET and CT on PET/CT studies when CT instead of germanium is used for attenuation correction (AC). METHODS: PET/CT scans were obtained for 300 clinical patients. Both CT and germanium scans were used to correct PET emission data. Cases were noted of suspected inaccurate localization of lesions on any of the 5 sets of images (PET using germanium AC [GeAC] fused and not fused with CT, PET using CT AC fused and not fused with CT, and PET with no AC [NAC]). Independent CT or MRI was used to determine true lesion locations. RESULTS: Six of 300 patients (2\%) had lesion mislocalization when CT was used for AC or fusion. True liver dome lesions were mislocalized to the right lung base on PET/CT, likely because of a respiratory motion difference between PET and CT. No mislocalization was present on NAC PET or non-CT-fused GeAC PET images. CONCLUSION: Serious lesion mislocalization on PET/CT studies may occur, albeit very infrequently, when CT is used for either AC or fusion.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To show the feasibility of magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) conductivity imaging in terms of its capability to provide new contrast information of abscess lesion and characterize time-course variations before and after the induction of brain abscess. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain abscess was induced in healthy beagles by a direct inoculation method using Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. After the induction, four electrodes were attached on the head and the dog was placed inside the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) bore. Using a current source, we injected a current of amplitude 5 mA and a pulse width of 81 msec. A multi-echo ICNE pulse sequence was used to obtain the magnetic flux density (B(z) ) data. RESULTS: The relative conductivity contrast ratios (rCCR, \%) of abscess lesion were significantly changed by the postinduction time (P < 0.01). The rCCRs of central abscess lesions were higher than the surrounding area at 6, 12, and 18 hours (P < 0.01). Over 12 hours, the relationship between the induction time and rCCR showed a positive correlation followed by a negative correlation (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: We performed in vivo disease model animal experiments to validate the MREIT technique providing conductivity information of tissues in situ to be utilized in clinical applications. J.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The electrical impedance tomography (EIT)-based global inhomogeneity (GI) index was introduced to quantify tidal volume distribution within the lung. Up to now, the GI index was evaluated for plausibility but the analysis of how it is influenced by various physiological factors is still missing. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of proportion of open lung regions measured by EIT on the GI index.

METHODS: A constant low-flow inflation maneuver was performed in 18 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients (58 ± 14 years, mean age ± SD) and 8 lung-healthy patients (41 ± 12 years) under controlled mechanical ventilation. EIT raw data were acquired at 25 scans/s and reconstructed offline. Recruited lung regions were identified as those image pixels of the lung regions within the EIT scans where local impedance amplitudes exceeded 10\% of the maximum amplitude during the maneuver. A series of GI indices was calculated during mechanical lung inflation, based on the differential images obtained between different time points. Respiratory system elastance (Ers) values were calculated at 10 lung volume levels during low-flow maneuver.

RESULTS: The GI index decreased during low-flow inflation, while the percentage of open lung regions increased. The values correlated highly in both ARDS (r2 = 0.88 ± 0.08, p < 0.01) and lung-healthy patients (r2 = 0.92 ± 0.05, p < 0.01). Ers and GI index were also significantly correlated in 16 out of 18 ARDS (r2 = 0.84 ± 0.13, p < 0.01) and in 6 out of 8 lung-healthy patients (r2 = 0.84 ± 0.07, p < 0.01). Significant differences were found in GI values between two groups (0.52 ± 0.21 for ARDS and 0.41 ± 0.04 for lung-healthy patients, p < 0.05) as well in Ers values (0.017 ± 0.008 cmH2O/ml for ARDS and 0.009 ± 0.001 cmH2O/ml for lung-healthy patients, p < 0.01).

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the GI index is a reliable measure of ventilation heterogeneity highly correlated with lung recruitability measured with EIT. The GI index may prove to be a useful EIT-based index to guide ventilation therapy.},

abstract = {Respiratory motion in emission tomography leads to reduced image quality. Developed correction methodology has been concentrating on the use of respiratory synchronized acquisitions leading to gated frames. Such frames, however, are of low signal-to-noise ratio as a result of containing reduced statistics. In this work, we describe the implementation of an elastic transformation within a list-mode-based reconstruction for the correction of respiratory motion over the thorax, allowing the use of all data available throughout a respiratory motion average acquisition. The developed algorithm was evaluated using datasets of the NCAT phantom generated at different points throughout the respiratory cycle. List-mode-data-based PET-simulated frames were subsequently produced by combining the NCAT datasets with Monte Carlo simulation. A non-rigid registration algorithm based on B-spline basis functions was employed to derive transformation parameters accounting for the respiratory motion using the NCAT dynamic CT images. The displacement matrices derived were subsequently applied during the image reconstruction of the original emission list mode data. Two different implementations for the incorporation of the elastic transformations within the one-pass list mode EM (OPL-EM) algorithm were developed and evaluated. The corrected images were compared with those produced using an affine transformation of list mode data prior to reconstruction, as well as with uncorrected respiratory motion average images. Results demonstrate that although both correction techniques considered lead to significant improvements in accounting for respiratory motion artefacts in the lung fields, the elastic-transformation-based correction leads to a more uniform improvement across the lungs for different lesion sizes and locations.},

abstract = {There is emerging evidence that the ventilation strategy used in acute lung injury (ALI) makes a significant difference in outcome and that an inappropriate ventilation strategy may produce ventilator-associated lung injury. Most harmful during mechanical ventilation are lung overdistension and lung collapse or atelectasis. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) as a non-invasive imaging technology may be helpful to identify lung areas at risk. Currently, no automated method is routinely available to identify lung areas that are overdistended, collapsed or ventilated appropriately. We propose a fuzzy logic-based algorithm to analyse EIT images obtained during stepwise changes of mean airway pressures during mechanical ventilation. The algorithm is tested on data from two published studies of stepwise inflation-deflation manoeuvres in an animal model of ALI using conventional and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. The timing of lung opening and collapsing on segmented images obtained using the algorithm during an inflation-deflation manoeuvre is in agreement with well-known effects of surfactant administration and changes in shunt fraction. While the performance of the algorithm has not been verified against a gold standard, we feel that it presents an important first step in tackling this challenging and important problem.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent method determines regional gas flow of the lung by electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The aim of this study is to show the applicability of this method in a porcine model of mechanical ventilation in healthy and diseased lungs. Our primary hypothesis is that global gas flow measured by EIT can be correlated with spirometry. Our secondary hypothesis is that regional analysis of respiratory gas flow delivers physiologically meaningful results.

METHODS: In two sets of experiments n = 7 healthy pigs and n = 6 pigs before and after induction of lavage lung injury were investigated. EIT of the lung and spirometry were registered synchronously during ongoing mechanical ventilation. In-vivo aeration of the lung was analysed in four regions-of-interest (ROI) by EIT: 1) global, 2) ventral (non-dependent), 3) middle and 4) dorsal (dependent) ROI. Respiratory gas flow was calculated by the first derivative of the regional aeration curve. Four phases of the respiratory cycle were discriminated. They delivered peak and late inspiratory and expiratory gas flow (PIF, LIF, PEF, LEF) characterizing early or late inspiration or expiration.

RESULTS: Linear regression analysis of EIT and spirometry in healthy pigs revealed a very good correlation measuring peak flow and a good correlation detecting late flow. PIFEIT = 0.702 . PIFspiro + 117.4, r2 = 0.809; PEFEIT = 0.690 . PEFspiro-124.2, r2 = 0.760; LIFEIT = 0.909 . LIFspiro + 27.32, r2 = 0.572 and LEFEIT = 0.858 . LEFspiro-10.94, r2 = 0.647. EIT derived absolute gas flow was generally smaller than data from spirometry. Regional gas flow was distributed heterogeneously during different phases of the respiratory cycle. But, the regional distribution of gas flow stayed stable during different ventilator settings. Moderate lung injury changed the regional pattern of gas flow.

CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the presented method is able to determine global respiratory gas flow of the lung in different phases of the respiratory cycle. Additionally, it delivers meaningful insight into regional pulmonary characteristics, i.e. the regional ability of the lung to take up and to release air.},

abstract = {Conductivity imaging of the breast using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a three-dimensional (3D) problem since the induced currents are free to travel through the entire tissue volume. It is therefore necessary to determine the effect this 3D current flow has on the image reconstruction problem and to ascertain how much benefit is gained by using a more appropriate 3D model to estimate the conductivity distribution. In addition, it is important to consider how much is gained if measurements are collected from multiple circular arrays of electrodes positioned around the breast as opposed to just a single plane of electrodes. We used a 64 electrode EIT system to collect data from a series of high contrast saline phantoms to determine the benefits gained by using a 3D model and the incorporation of out-of-plane measurements. We found that it is preferable to use a 3D mesh even when looking only at a single plane through the object of interest and that this 3D mesh should extend in the axial direction at least one radius away from the plane of interest. Further, out-of-plane measurements enhance axial information and improve the quantification of reconstructed inclusions by a factor of 2.2 in the particular case presented here. These findings should ultimately be incorporated to clinical imaging with EIT when circular electrode arrays are employed.},

One approach to this problem is to first rebin the data into one of the following lower dimensional formats: 2D TOF, 3D non TOF or 2D non TOF. Here we present a unified framework based on a generalized projection slice theorem for TOF data that can be used to compute each of these mappings. We use this framework to develop approaches for rebinning into non TOF formats without significant loss of information. We first derive the exact mappings and then describe approximations which address the missing data problem for oblique sinograms. We evaluate the performance of approximate rebinning using Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that rebinning into non TOF sinograms retains significant SNR advantages over sinograms collected without TOF information.},

abstract = {There is a strong clinical demand for devices allowing continuous non-invasive monitoring of central blood pressure (BP). In the state of the art a new family of techniques providing BP surrogates based on the measurement of the so-called pulse wave velocity (PWV) has been proposed, eliminating the need for inflation cuffs. PWV is defined as the velocity at which pressure pulses propagate along the arterial wall. However, no technique to assess PWV within central arteries in a fully unsupervised manner has been proposed so far. In this pilot study, we provide first experimental evidence that electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is capable of measuring pressure pulses directly within the descending aorta. To obtain a wide range of BP values, we administrated noradrenalin and nitroglycerine to an anesthetized pig under mechanical ventilation. An arterial line was inserted into the ascending aorta for measuring reference BP. EIT images were generated from 32 impedance electrodes placed around the chest at the level of the axilla. Regions of Interest (ROI) such as the descending aorta and the lungs were automatically identified by a novel time-based processing algorithm as the respective EIT pixels representing these structures. The correct positions of these ROIs were confirmed by bolus injections of highly conductive concentrated saline into the right heart and into the ascending aorta. Aortic pulse transit time (PTT) values were determined as the delay between the opening of the aortic valve (obtained from arterial line) and the arrival of pressure pulses at the aortic ROI within the EIT plane. For 11 experimental conditions, with mean BP ranging from 73 to 141 mmHg, strongly significant correlation (r = -0.97, P < 0.00001) between central BP and aortic PTT was observed, suggesting that EIT-derived aortic PTT is a potential non-invasive surrogate of central BP.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) has the potential to achieve non-invasive functional imaging of fast neuronal activity in the human brain due to opening of ion channels during neuronal depolarization. Local changes of resistance in the cerebral cortex are about 1\%, but the size and location of changes recorded on the scalp are unknown. The purpose of this work was to develop an anatomically realistic finite element model of the adult human head and use it to predict the amplitude and topography of changes on the scalp, and so inform specification for an in vivo measuring system. A detailed anatomically realistic finite element (FE) model of the head was produced from high resolution MRI. Simulations were performed for impedance changes in the visual cortex during evoked activity with recording of scalp potentials by electrodes or magnetic flux density by magnetoencephalography (MEG) in response to current injected with electrodes. The predicted changes were validated by recordings in saline filled tanks and with boundary voltages measured on the human scalp. Peak changes were 1.03 +/- 0.75 microV (0.0039 +/- 0.0034\%) and 27 +/- 13 fT (0.2 +/- 0.5\%) respectively, which yielded an estimated peak signal-to-noise ratio of about 4 for in vivo averaging over 10 min and 1 mA current injection. The largest scalp changes were over the occipital cortex. This modelling suggests, for the first time, that reproducible changes could be recorded on the scalp in vivo in single channels, although a higher SNR would be desirable for accurate image production. The findings suggest that an in vivo study is warranted in order to determine signal size but methods to improve SNR, such as prolonged averaging or other signal processing may be needed for accurate image production.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography is a highly unstable problem with respect to measurement and modeling errors. This instability is especially severe when absolute imaging is considered. With clinical measurements, accurate knowledge about the body shape is usually not available, and therefore an approximate model domain has to be used in the computational model. It has earlier been shown that large reconstruction artefacts result if the geometry of the model domain is incorrect. In this paper, we adapt the so-called approximation error approach to compensate for the modeling errors caused by inaccurately known body shape. This approach has previously been shown to be applicable to a variety of modeling errors, such as coarse discretization in the numerical approximation of the forward model and domain truncation. We evaluate the approach with a simulated example of thorax imaging, and also with experimental data from a laboratory setting, with absolute imaging considered in both cases. We show that the related modeling errors can be efficiently compensated for by the approximation error approach. We also show that recovery from simultaneous discretization related errors is feasible, allowing the use of computationally efficient reduced order models.},

Preterm rabbit pups (28 days gestation) were delivered and mechanically ventilated with one of three strategies, whereby PEEP was changed in sequence; 0-5-10-5-0 cmH2O, 5-10-0-5-0 cmH2O or 10-5-0-10-0 cmH2O. Phase contrast X-ray imaging was used to analyse the distribution of ventilation in the upper left (UL), upper right (UR), lower left (LL) and lower right (LR) quadrants of the lung. Initiating ventilation with 10PEEP resulted in a uniform increase in FRC throughout the lung whereas initiating ventilation with 5PEEP or 0PEEP preferentially aerated the UR than both lower quadrants (p<0.05). Consequently, the relative distribution of incoming VT was preferentially directed into the lower lobes at low PEEP, primarily due to the loss of FRC in those lobes. Following ventilation at 10PEEP, the distribution of air at end-inflation was uniform across all quadrants and remained so regardless of the PEEP level. Uniform distribution of ventilation can be achieved by initiating ventilation with a high PEEP. After the lungs have aerated, small and stepped reductions in PEEP result in more uniform changes in ventilation.},

abstract = {An electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system images internal conductivity from surface electrical stimulation and measurement. Such systems necessarily comprise multiple design choices from cables and hardware design to calibration and image reconstruction. In order to compare EIT systems and study the consequences of changes in system performance, this paper describes a systematic approach to evaluate the performance of the EIT systems. The system to be tested is connected to a saline phantom in which calibrated contrasting test objects are systematically positioned using a position controller. A set of evaluation parameters are proposed which characterize (i) data and image noise, (ii) data accuracy, (iii) detectability of single contrasts and distinguishability of multiple contrasts, and (iv) accuracy of reconstructed image (amplitude, resolution, position and ringing). Using this approach, we evaluate three different EIT systems and illustrate the use of these tools to evaluate and compare performance. In order to facilitate the use of this approach, all details of the phantom, test objects and position controller design are made publicly available including the source code of the evaluation and reporting software.},

The focus of this review is to discuss the balance between the potential for EIT as a clinical monitor accepting a level of uncertainty and the scientific demand for absolute perfection. RECENT FINDINGS: The controversy concerning whether EIT impedance changes can be safely used to monitor lung volume changes now appears to be solved after recent elegant studies. It is now high time to display lung volume changes measured by EIT in clinical units, that is in millilitres following calibration versus tidal volume. A growing number of indices for regional ventilation distribution are emerging some of which should be further evaluated and developed for clinical decision support. SUMMARY: Already now EIT is a useful clinical monitor. Still more work is needed to develop and interpret indices which are simple enough to be used in the clinical setting to guide the clinician towards effective and safe ventilator management.},

abstract = {Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a technique that makes it possible to measure ventilation and pulmonary perfusion in a volume that approximates to a 2D plane. The possibility of using EIT for measuring the left-right division of ventilation and perfusion was compared with that of radionuclide imaging. Following routine ventilation (81mKr) and perfusion scanning (99mTc-MAA), EIT measurements were performed at the third and the sixth intercostal level in 14 patients with lung cancer. A correlation (r = 0.98, p < 0.005) between the left-right division for the ventilation measured with EIT and that with 81mKr was found. For the left-right division of pulmonary perfusion a correlation of 0.95 (p < 0.005) was found between the two methods. The reliability coefficient (RC) was calculated for estimating the left-right division with EIT. The RC for the ventilation measurements was 94\% and 96\% for the perfusion measurements. The correlation analysis for reproducibility of the EIT measurements was 0.95 (p < 0.001) for the ventilation and 0.93 (p < 0.001) for the perfusion measurements. In conclusion, EIT can be regarded as a promising technique to estimate the left-right division of pulmonary perfusion and ventilation.},

abstract = {Latest experimental results in magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) demonstrated high-resolution in vivo conductivity imaging of animal and human subjects using imaging currents of 5 to 9 mA. Externally injected imaging currents induce magnetic flux density distributions, which are affected by a conductivity distribution. Since we extract the induced magnetic flux density images from MR phase images, it is essential to reduce noise in the phase images. In vivo human and disease model animal experiments require reduction of imaging current amplitudes and scan times. In this article, we investigate a multi-echo based MREIT pulse sequence where we utilize a remaining time after the first echo within one TR to obtain more echo signals. It also allows us to prolong the total current injection time. From phantom and animal imaging experiments, we found that this method significantly reduces the noise level in measured magnetic flux density images. We describe experimental validation of the multi-echo sequence by comparing its performance with a single-echo method using 3 mA imaging currents. The proposed method will be advantageous for an imaging region with long T2 values such as the brain and knee. Depending on T2 values, we suggest using two or three echoes in future experimental studies.},

abstract = {Current methods for identifying ventilated lung regions utilizing electrical impedance tomography images rely on dividing the image into arbitrary regions of interest (ROI), manually delineating ROI, or forming ROI with pixels whose signal properties surpass an arbitrary threshold. In this paper, we propose a novel application of a data-driven classification method to identify ventilated lung ROI based on forming k clusters from pixels with correlated signals. A standard first-order model for lung mechanics is then applied to determine which ROI correspond to ventilated lung tissue. We applied the method in an experimental study of 16 mechanically ventilated swine in the supine position, which underwent changes in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen (F(I)O(2)). In each stage of the experimental protocol, the method performed best with k = 4 and consistently identified 3 lung tissue ROI and 1 boundary tissue ROI in 15 of the 16 subjects. When testing for changes from baseline in lung position, tidal volume, and respiratory system compliance, we found that PEEP displaced the ventilated lung region dorsally by 2 cm, decreased tidal volume by 1.3\%, and increased the respiratory system compliance time constant by 0.3 s. F(I)O(2) decreased tidal volume by 0.7\%. All effects were tested at p < 0.05 with n = 16. These findings suggest that the proposed ROI detection method is robust and sensitive to ventilation dynamics in the experimental setting.},

Based on a section covering the dosimetric impact of organ motion, motion management during treatment planning, patient positioning, treatment delivery and treatment validation will be summarized. For scattered beam delivery, the concepts and data are often based on clinical usage since treatment of moving tumors has been performed for several years. In the field of scanned beam delivery, the report focuses on the results of research on countermeasures of the interference effect.

abstract = {Dynamic thoracic EIT is capable of detecting changes of the ventilation distribution in the lung. Nevertheless, it has yet to become an established clinical tool. Therefore, it is necessary to consider application scenarios wherein fast and distinct changes of the tissue conductivities are to be found and also have a clear diagnostic significance. One such a scenario is the artificial ventilation of patients suffering from the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). New protective ventilation strategies involving recruitment manoeuvres are associated with noticeable shifts of body fluids and regional ventilation, which can quite easily be detected by EIT. The bedside assessment of these recruitment manoeuvres will help the attending physician to optimize treatment. Hence, we performed an animal study of lavage-induced lung failure and investigated if EIT is capable of qualitatively as well as quantitatively monitoring lung recruitment during a stepwise PEEP trial. Additionally, we integrated EIT into a fuzzy controller-based ventilation system which allows one to perform automated recruitment manoeuvres (open lung concept) based on online PaO2 measurements. We found that EIT is a useful tool to titrate the proper PEEP level after fully recruiting the lung. Furthermore, EIT seems to be able to determine the status of recruitment when combining it with other physiological parameters. These results suggest that EIT may play an important role in the individualization of protective ventilation strategies.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to quantify patterns of age-related shape change in the human thorax using Procrustes superimposition. Landmarks (n=106) selected from anonymized computed tomography (CT) scans of 63 adult males free of skeletal pathology were used to describe the form of the rib cage. Multivariate linear regression was used to determine a relationship between landmark location and age. Linear and quadratic models were also investigated. A permutation test employing 1 x 10(5) random trials was used to assess the model significance for both model formulations. Linear relationships between the centroid size (CS) of a landmark set and the corresponding individual's height, weight, and BMI were conducted to enable scaling of the dimensionless results from the Procrustes analysis. A significance level of alpha=0.05 was used for all tests. The average age of the study subjects was 57.0+/-17.3 years. Complete landmark sets were obtained from most of the scans (44 of 63). The quadratic relationship between the age and landmark location was found to be significant (p=0.037), thereby establishing a relationship between the age and thoracic shape change. The linear relationship was mildly significant as well (p=0.073). Significant relationships between the centroid size of the dataset and subject weight, height and BMI were determined, with the best-correlated value being weight (p=0.002, R(2)=0.22). Landmark datasets calculated using the quadratic model exhibited shape change consistent with the clinical observations (increasing kyphosis and rounding of the thoracic cage). Procrustes superimposition represents a potential improvement in the approach used to generate computational models for injury biomechanics studies. The coefficients from the quadratic model are provided and can be used to generate the complete set of model landmark data points at a given age.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether, during mechanical ventilation, an optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can be identified by measurement of regional tidal volume and compliance [V (T(reg)), C (RS(reg))]. METHODS: Sixteen anaesthetized intubated neonatal piglets underwent a stepwise vital capacity manoeuvre performed during pressure control ventilation, with 5 cmH₂O PEEP increments to 25 cmH₂O, and decrements to 0 cmH₂O. Peak inflating pressure was 10 cmH₂O above PEEP throughout. The manoeuvre was performed in the normal lung, after repeated saline lavage and after surfactant therapy. Global V (T) and C (RS) were measured at the airway opening; V (T(reg)) and C (RS(reg)) were measured in the ventral, medial and dorsal lung using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). RESULTS: Most uniform distribution of regional tidal ventilation was noted during PEEP decrements after lung recruitment, at varying PEEP levels. In the lavaged and surfactant-treated lung the PEEP optimal for ventilation distribution was also associated with highest mean V (T(reg)) [lavaged: 95 ± 9.3\% of maximum, mean ± standard deviation (SD); surfactant-treated: 92 ± 17\%] and global V (T) (96 ± 10\%; 96 ± 15\%). Regional C (RS) plots clearly demonstrated co-existent ventral overdistension and dorsal recruitment, particularly during PEEP increments; whereas during PEEP decrements, peak C (RS(reg)) values showed considerable interregional concordance [e.g. peak C (RS(reg)) in the lavaged left lung; ventral: 0.017 ± 0.0036; medial: 0.016 ± 0.0054; dorsal: 0.017 ± 0.0073 cmH₂O⁻¹; P = 0.98, analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. CONCLUSIONS: After lung recruitment, a PEEP level can be identified by EIT at which tidal ventilation is uniformly distributed, with associated concordance in compliance between lung regions. Bedside monitoring of regional tidal ventilation and compliance using EIT may thus aid in PEEP selection.},

abstract = {Magnetic induction tomography (MIT) attempts to image the electrical and magnetic characteristics of a target using impedance measurement data from pairs of excitation and detection coils. This inverse eddy current problem is nonlinear and also severely ill posed so regularization is required for a stable solution. A regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm has been implemented as a nonlinear, iterative inverse solver. In this algorithm, one needs to solve the forward problem and recalculate the Jacobian matrix for each iteration. The forward problem has been solved using an edge based finite element method for magnetic vector potential A and electrical scalar potential V, a so called A, A - V formulation. A theoretical study of the general inverse eddy current problem and a derivation, paying special attention to the boundary conditions, of an adjoint field formula for the Jacobian is given. This efficient formula calculates the change in measured induced voltage due to a small perturbation of the conductivity in a region. This has the advantage that it involves only the inner product of the electric fields when two different coils are excited, and these are convenient computationally. This paper also shows that the sensitivity maps change significantly when the conductivity distribution changes, demonstrating the necessity for a nonlinear reconstruction algorithm. The performance of the inverse solver has been examined and results presented from simulated data with added noise.},

@article{Tsien-surgery-review,
abstract = {Although the modern surgical era is highlighted by multiple technological advances and innovations, one area that has remained constant is the dependence of the surgeon's vision on white-light reflectance. This renders different body tissues in a limited palette of various shades of pink and red, thereby limiting the visual contrast available to the operating surgeon. Healthy tissue, anatomic variations, and diseased states are seen as slight discolorations relative to each other and differences are inherently limited in dynamic range. In the upcoming years, surgery will undergo a paradigm shift with the use of targeted fluorescence imaging probes aimed at augmenting the surgical armamentarium by expanding the "visible" spectrum available to surgeons. Such fluorescent "smart probes" will provide real-time, intraoperative, pseudo-color, high-contrast delineation of both normal and pathologic tissues. Fluorescent surgical molecular guidance promises another major leap forward to improve patient safety and clinical outcomes, and to reduce overall healthcare costs. This review provides an overview of current and future surgical applications of fluorescence imaging in diseased and nondiseased tissues and focus on the innovative fields of image processing and instrumentation.},

abstract = {Pulmonary oxygen (O(2)) uptake during apnoea results in a fall in lung volume. Given that electrical impedance tomography (EIT) provides reliable data on regional lung volume changes we hypothesized that EIT could be used to measure regional O(2) uptake. A total of 12 lung healthy supine patients were studied. EIT measurements were performed during volume-controlled mechanical ventilation followed by apnoea with the endotracheal tube clamped at end-expiration. Lung function parameters were assessed by spirometry. A device for breath-by-breath monitoring metabolic gas exchange was used to measure global O(2) uptake. Relative impedance changes during ventilation and apnoea were related to the corresponding tidal volumes. Regional O(2) uptake was analysed as absolute values and as a ratio to regional ventilation in two regions of interest (ventral and dorsal). The global O(2) uptake measured by EIT was 208 ± 79 ml min(-1) corresponding to the values obtained by metabolic gas exchange (259 ± 73 ml min(-1); Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.81, p = 0.02). Regional O(2) uptake was significantly higher in the ventral lung region, while the regional O(2) uptake/ventilation ratio showed no significant difference between the regions. In conclusion, our pilot study indicates that EIT holds substantial potential to detect global and regional pulmonary O(2) uptake concordant with a linear lung volume decrease during apnoea.},

abstract = {Global pressure-volume (PV) curves are an adjunct measure to describe lung characteristics in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is convincing evidence that high peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) cause barotrauma, while optimized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) helps avoid mechanical injury to the lungs by preventing repeated alveolar opening and closing. The optimal values of PIP and PEEP are deduced from the shape of the PV curve by the identification of so-called lower and upper inflection points. However, it has been demonstrated using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) that the inflection points vary across the lung. This study employs a simple curve-fitting technique to automatically define inflection points on both pressure-volume (PV) and pressure-impedance (PI) curves to asses the differences between global PV and regional PI estimates in animals before and after induced lung injury. The results demonstrate a clear increase in lower inflection point (LIP) along the gravitational axis both before and after lung injury. Moreover, it is clear from comparison of the local EIT-derived LIPs with those derived from global PV curves that a ventilation strategy based on the PV curve alone may leave dependent areas of the lung collapsed. EIT-based PI curve analysis may help choosing an optimal ventilation strategy.},

In this study, we assess the ability of MREIT to monitor changes in the conductivity distribution of an agarose gel phantom, using injected current pulses of 900 microA. The phantom initially contained a distinct region of high sodium chloride concentration which diffused into the background over time. MREIT data were collected over a 12 h span, and conductivity images were reconstructed using the iterative sensitivity matrix method with Tikhonov regularization. The results indicate that MREIT was able to monitor the changing conductivity and concentration distributions resulting from the diffusion of ions within the agarose gel phantom.},

It has thus been apparent, since the early days of EIT research, that imaging of ventilation could become a key clinical application of EIT. In this paper, we review the current state and future prospects for lung EIT, by a synthesis of the presentations of the authors at the 'special lung sessions' of the annual biomedical EIT conferences in 2009-2011. We argue that lung EIT research has arrived at an important transition. It is now clear that valid and reproducible physiological information is available from EIT lung images. We must now ask the question: How can these data be used to help improve patient outcomes? To answer this question, we develop a classification of possible clinical scenarios in which EIT could play an important role, and we identify clinical and experimental research programmes and engineering developments required to turn EIT into a clinically useful tool for lung monitoring.},

abstract = {Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an imaging method which enables a volume conductivity map of a subject to be produced from multiple impedance measurements. It has the potential to become a portable non-invasive imaging technique of particular use in imaging brain function. Accurate numerical forward models may be used to improve image reconstruction but, until now, have employed an assumption of isotropic tissue conductivity. This may be expected to introduce inaccuracy, as body tissues, especially those such as white matter and the skull in head imaging, are highly anisotropic. The purpose of this study was, for the first time, to develop a method for incorporating anisotropy in a forward numerical model for EIT of the head and assess the resulting improvement in image quality in the case of linear reconstruction of one example of the human head. A realistic Finite Element Model (FEM) of an adult human head with segments for the scalp, skull, CSF, and brain was produced from a structural MRI. Anisotropy of the brain was estimated from a diffusion tensor-MRI of the same subject and anisotropy of the skull was approximated from the structural information. A method for incorporation of anisotropy in the forward model and its use in image reconstruction was produced. The improvement in reconstructed image quality was assessed in computer simulation by producing forward data, and then linear reconstruction using a sensitivity matrix approach. The mean boundary data difference between anisotropic and isotropic forward models for a reference conductivity was 50\%. Use of the correct anisotropic FEM in image reconstruction, as opposed to an isotropic one, corrected an error of 24 mm in imaging a 10\% conductivity decrease located in the hippocampus, improved localisation for conductivity changes deep in the brain and due to epilepsy by 4-17 mm, and, overall, led to a substantial improvement on image quality. This suggests that incorporation of anisotropy in numerical models used for image reconstruction is likely to improve EIT image quality.},

abstract = {The practical use of realistic models in bioelectromagnetism is limited by the time-consuming amount of numerical calculations. We propose a method leading to much higher speed than currently available, and compatible with any kind of numerical methods (boundary elements (BEM), finite ele- ments, finite differences). Illustrated with the BEMfor EEG and MEG, it applies to ECG andMCG as well. The principle is two-fold. First, a Lead-Field matrix is calculated (once for all) for a grid of dipoles covering the brain volume. Second, any forward solution is interpolated from the pre-calculated Lead-Fields corresponding to grid dipoles near the source. Extrapolation is used for shallowsources falling outside the grid. Three interpolation techniques were tested: trilinear, second-order Be and 3D spline. The trilinear interpolation yielded the highest speed gain, with factors better than 10,000 for a 9,000-triangle BEM model. More accurate results could be obtained with the Be ´zier (Bernstein polynomials), ´zier interpolation (speed gain1,000), which, combined with a 8-mmstep grid, lead to intrinsic localization and orientation errors of only 0.2 mm and 0.2 degrees. Further improvements in MEG could be obtained by interpolating only the contribution of secondary currents. Cropping grids by removing shallow points lead to a much better estimation of the dipole orientation in EEG than when solving the forward problem classically, providing an efficient alternative to locally refined models. This method would show special useful- ness when combining realistic models with stochastic inverse procedures (simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) requiring many forward calculations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To utilize real-time electrical impedance tomography to guide lung protective ventilation in an animal model of acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN: Prospective animal study. SETTING: Animal research center. SUBJECTS: Twelve Yorkshire swine (15 kg). INTERVENTIONS: Lung injury was induced with saline lavage and augmented using large tidal volumes. The control group (n = 6) was ventilated using ARDSnet guidelines, and the electrical impedance tomography-guided group (n = 6) was ventilated using guidance with real-time electrical impedance tomography lung imaging. Regional electrical impedance tomography-derived compliance was used to maximize the recruitment of dependent lung and minimize overdistension of nondependent lung areas. Tidal volume was 6 mL/kg in both groups. Computed tomography was performed in a subset of animals to define the anatomic correlates of electrical impedance tomography imaging (n = 5). Interleukin-8 was quantified in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Sections of dependent and nondependent regions of the lung were fixed in formalin for histopathologic analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Positive end-expiratory pressure levels were higher in the electrical impedance tomography-guided group (14.3 cm H₂O vs. 8.6 cm H₂O; p < 0.0001), whereas plateau pressures did not differ. Global respiratory system compliance was improved in the electrical impedance tomography-guided group (6.9 mL/cm H₂O vs. 4.7 mL/cm H₂O; p = 0.013). Regional electrical impedance tomography-derived compliance of the most dependent lung region was increased in the electrical impedance tomography group (1.78 mL/cm H₂O vs. 0.99 mL/cm H₂O; p = 0.001). Pao₂/FIO₂ ratio was higher and oxygenation index was lower in the electrical impedance tomography-guided group (Pao₂/FIO₂: 388 mm Hg vs. 113 mm Hg, p < 0.0001; oxygentation index, 6.4 vs. 15.7; p = 0.02) (all averages over the 6-hr time course). The presence of hyaline membranes (HM) and airway fibrin (AF) was significantly reduced in the electrical impedance tomography-guided group (HMEIT 42\% samples vs. HMCONTROL 67\% samples, p < 0.01; AFEIT 75\% samples vs. AFCONTROL 100\% samples, p < 0.01). Interleukin-8 level (bronchoalveolar lavage) did not differ between the groups. The upper and lower 95\% limits of agreement between electrical impedance tomography and computed tomography were ± 16\%. CONCLUSIONS: Electrical impedance tomography-guided ventilation resulted in improved respiratory mechanics, improved gas exchange, and reduced histologic evidence of ventilator-induced lung injury in an animal model. This is the first prospective use of electrical impedance tomography-derived variables to improve outcomes in the setting of acute lung injury.},

abstract = {Fluorouracil (FU) is the most common cytostatic agent used for chemotherapy in patients with colorectal tumors. Fifty patients with 78 hepatic metastases from colorectal tumors were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) following intravenous infusion of 18F-FU. The uptake of the cytostatic agent was evaluated in normal liver parenchyma, liver metastases and the aorta. Tracer uptake was expressed with the standardized uptake value (SUV). The maximum liver activity was 11.3 SUV (mean value) with a standard deviation of 1.85 SUV. The highest activity concentrations were noted 30 min (mean value) postinjection. In comparison, the activity concentration of individual metastasis was low. Two hours after tracer injection, the mean activity in metastases was 1.3 SUV, but notable individual variation in uptake was seen. Fluorine-18 concentration values 2 hr after FU infusion were approximately 44\% of the FU uptake 20 min postinfusion. Fifty-three metastases were also examined with 15O-labeled water. The examination was performed to compare the uptake of the nonmetabolized tracer with FU uptake. We noted a statistically significant correlation between 15O-water concentration, uptake of nonmetabolized FU 8 min after the end of the infusion and FU retention (120 min postinjection) in a subgroup of metastases. The results suggest that FU retention in different metastases is highly variable and mainly dependent on early FU uptake into tumor cells.},

A near-infrared fluorophore, IRDye 800CW, emission maximum 794 nm, was conjugated to 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). An immunofluorescent cell-based assay was used to evaluate specificity and sensitivity of the conjugate in cultured cell monolayers. Dose-dependent uptake was established with increasing concentrations of IRDye 800CW 2-DG for epithelial and prostate carcinomas. IRDye 800CW 2-DG was specifically blocked by an antibody against GLUT1 glucose transporter, and by excess unlabeled 2-DG or d-glucose. Signal was increased by a phorbol ester activator of glucose transport. Fluorescence microscopy data confirmed localization of the conjugate in the cytoplasm. Subsequent in vivo studies optimized dose, clearance, and timing for signal capture in nude mouse xenografts. In all cases, tumors were clearly imaged with good signal-to-noise characteristics. These data indicate that IRDye 800CW 2-DG is a broadly applicable optical imaging agent for in vivo imaging of neoplasms in mice.},

@article{Nitin2009,
abstract = {The clinical value of assessing tumor glucose metabolism via F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging in oncology is well established; however, the poor spatial resolution of PET is a significant limitation especially for early stage lesions. An alternative technology is optical molecular imaging, which allows for subcellular spatial resolution and can be effectively used with topical contrast agents for imaging epithelial derived cancers. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of optical molecular imaging of glucose metabolism to aid in early detection of oral neoplasia. Fluorescently labeled deoxyglucose (2-NBDG (2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-D-glucose)) was applied topically to tissue phantoms, fresh oral biopsies (n = 32) and resected tumors specimens (n = 2). High-resolution imaging results show that 2-NBDG can be rapidly delivered to oral epithelium using topical application. In normal epithelium, the uptake of 2-NBDG is limited to basal epithelial cells. In contrast, high-grade dysplasia and cancers show uptake of 2-NBDG in neoplastic cells throughout the lesion. Following 2-NBDG labeling, the mean fluorescence intensity of neoplastic tissue averages 3.7 times higher than that of matched nonneoplastic oral biopsies in samples from 20 patients. Widefield fluorescence images of 8-paired oral specimens were obtained pre and postlabeling with 2-NBDG. Prior to labeling, neoplastic samples showed significantly lower autofluorescence than nonneoplastic samples. The fluorescence of neoplastic samples increased dramatically after labeling; the differential increase in fluorescence was on average 30 times higher in neoplastic samples than in normal samples. Topical application of 2-NBDG can therefore provide image contrast in both widefield and high-resolution fluorescence imaging modalities, highlighting its potential in early detection of oral neoplasia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is recognized that cancer cells exhibit highly elevated glucose metabolism compared to non-tumor cells. We have applied in vivo optical imaging to study dynamic uptake of a near-infrared dye-labeled glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) by orthotopic glioma in a mouse model. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The orthotopic glioma model was established by surgically implanting U87-luc glioma cells into the right caudal nuclear area of nude mice. Intracranial tumor growth was monitored longitudinally by bioluminescence imaging and MRI. When tumor size reached >4 mm diameter, dynamic fluorescence imaging was performed after an injection of the NIR labeled 2-DG, IRDye800CW 2-DG. Real-time whole body images acquired immediately after i.v. infusion clearly visualized the near-infrared dye circulating into various internal organs sequentially. Dynamic fluorescence imaging revealed significantly higher signal intensity in the tumor side of the brain than the contralateral normal brain 24 h after injection (tumor/normal ratio, TNR = 2.8+/-0.7). Even stronger contrast was achieved by removing the scalp (TNR = 3.7+/-1.1) and skull (TNR = 4.2+/-1.1) of the mice. In contrast, a control dye, IRDye800CW carboxylate, showed little difference (1.1+/-0.2). Ex vivo fluorescence imaging performed on ultrathin cryosections (20 microm) of tumor bearing whole brain revealed distinct tumor margins. Microscopic imaging identified cytoplasmic locations of the 2-DG dye in tumor cells. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the near-infrared dye labeled 2-DG may serve as a useful fluorescence imaging probe to noninvasively assess intracranial tumor burden in preclinical animal models.},

abstract = {We describe the application of a time domain diffuse fluorescence tomography system for whole body small animal imaging. The key features of the system are the use of point excitation in free space using ultrashort laser pulses and noncontact detection using a gated, intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Mouse shaped epoxy phantoms, with embedded fluorescent inclusions, were used to verify the performance of a recently developed asymptotic lifetime-based tomography algorithm. The asymptotic algorithm is based on a multiexponential analysis of the decay portion of the data. The multiexponential model is shown to enable the use of a global analysis approach for a robust recovery of the lifetime components present within the imaging medium. The surface boundaries of the imaging volume were acquired using a photogrammetric camera integrated with the imaging system, and implemented in a Monte-Carlo model of photon propagation in tissue. The tomography results show that the asymptotic approach is able to separate axially located fluorescent inclusions centered at depths of 4 and 10 mm from the surface of the mouse phantom. The fluorescent inclusions had distinct lifetimes of 0.5 and 0.95 ns. The inclusions were nearly overlapping along the measurement axis and shown to be not resolvable using continuous wave (CW) methods. These results suggest the practical feasibility and advantages of a time domain approach for whole body small animal fluorescence molecular imaging, particularly with the use of lifetime as a contrast mechanism.},

The following reconstruction procedure is proposed: firstly, standard x-ray CT image reconstruction is performed employing the FDK algorithm. Secondly, standard SPECT image reconstruction is performed using OSEM. Thirdly, from the reconstructed CT volume data the surface boundary of the imaged object is extracted for finite element definition. Finally, the reconstructed SPECT data are used as a priori information within a Bayesian reconstruction framework for optical (FMT) reconstruction. We provide results of this multi-modal approach using phantom experimental data and illustrate that this strategy does suppress artifacts and facilitates quantitative analysis for optical imaging studies.},

The imaging is performed on three live nude mice in which tritium-powered light sources are surgically implanted. High-resolution magnetic resonance images and multispectral, multiview bioluminescence images are acquired in the same session. An anatomical model is constructed by segmenting the magnetic resonance images for all major tissues. The model is subsequently registered with nonlinear transformations to the 3-D light exittance (exiting intensity) surface map generated from the luminescence images. A Monte Carlo algorithm, along with a set of tissue optical properties obtained from in vivo measurements, is used to solve the forward problem. The measured and simulated light exittance images are found to differ by a factor of up to 2. The greatest cause of this moderate discrepancy is traced to the small errors in source positioning, and to a lesser extent to the optical properties used for the tissues. Discarding the anatomy and using a homogeneous model leads to a marginally worse agreement between the simulated and measured data.},

abstract = {Prostate cancer (CaP) cells possess high affinity for bone marrow and predilection to induce bone metastasis. Although the end result of metastasis is predominantly osteoblastic, most patients present mixed lesions with osteolytic component which could initiate and precede bone formation. A precise characterization of tumor-induced bone resorption is thus necessary for early evaluation of therapeutic efficiency. Herein, we investigate the advantage of combining micro-computed tomography (microCT) and in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to determine the kinetics of the intraosseous CaP growth and bone lesions appearance in an experimental murine model. To mimic established osteolytic bone metastasis, the left tibiae of SCID mice were injected with the human CaP cell line PC-3 expressing luciferase (PC-3 Luc). Noninvasive monitoring of tumor progression was followed weekly by BLI during 4 weeks and bone morphometric parameters were quantified by microCT. Data were compared with conventional radiological and histological analyses. While BLI monitoring in vivo revealed an exponential growth of PC-3 Luc after 2 weeks, a decrease of bone density and bone mineral content was evidenced by microCT as early as 7 days post-injection, reaching significant values at day 21 (30\% and 25\% loss, respectively), compared with mock-injected controls. Enhanced osteoclast TRAP activity was observed during the first two weeks, highlighting an active interaction between low proliferative PC-3 cells and osteoclasts at the early stage of tumor establishment in bone. Tumor growth detected by BLI was tightly correlated to the osteolysis assessed by microCT (p<0.05). Our results show that the combination of microCT and BLI applied to this tumor osteolysis murine model allows early measurement of intraosseous tumor growth and bone destruction, as well as correlation between both processes kinetics. This model will help to assess new therapeutic approaches targeting intraosseous tumor growth or tumor/osteoclast crosstalk.},

For this modality, an effective reconstruction algorithm is developed to reconstruct fluorescent yield and lifetime using finite element techniques. In the steady state mode, a direct linear relationship is established between measured optical data on the body surface of a small animal and the unknown fluorescent yield inside the animal, and the reconstruction of fluorescent yield is formulated as a linear least square minimization problem. In the frequency domain mode, based on localization results of the fluorescent probe obtained using the first mode, the reconstruction of fluorescent lifetime is transformed into a relatively simple optimization problem. This algorithm helps overcome the ill-posedness with FMT. The effectiveness of the proposed method is numerically demonstrated using a heterogeneous mouse chest phantom, showing good accuracy, stability, noise characteristics and computational efficiency.},

abstract = {Most PET kinetic modeling approaches have at their basis a compartmental model that has first-order, constant coefficients. The present article outlines the one-, two-, and three-compartment models used to measure cerebral blood flow, cerebral glucose metabolism, and receptor binding, respectively. The number of compartments of each model is based on specific knowledge of the physiological and/or biochemical compartments into which the tracer distributes. Additional physical and biochemical properties of the tracer distribution are considered in specifying the use of first-order rate constants. For example, in cerebral blood flow and receptor binding studies transport across the blood-brain barrier by diffusion can be modeled as a first-order process. A saturable carrier-mediated process or saturable enzyme catalyzed reaction, when tracer doses of the labeled substrate are used and the natural substrate is in steady-state, also results in first-order rate constants, as in glucose metabolism studies. The rate of ligand binding, on the other hand, depends on the concentrations of both substrate and available receptors. In order to appropriately model the reaction as pseudo first-order during a specified experimental interval, protocols are carefully designed to assure that the number of available binding sites remains approximately constant throughout the given interval. A broad array of scanning protocols is employed for kinetic analyses. These include single-scan approaches, which function like their autoradiographic counterparts in animal studies and are often called "autoradiographic" methods, which allow estimation of a single parameter. Dynamic scanning to obtain the time course of tissue activity allows simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters. Scanning may be conducted during a period of tracer uptake or after attainment of steady-state conditions. All quantitative modeling approaches share the common requirement that an arterial input function be measured or an appropriate surrogate be found. A vast array of methods is available for estimation of model parameters, both micro and macro. In the final analysis, it is the interaction among all elements of the PET study, including careful tracer selection, model specification, experimental protocol design, and sound parameter estimation methods, that determines the quantitative accuracy of the estimates of the physiological or biochemical process under study.},

abstract = {The feasibility and limits in performing tomographic bioluminescence imaging with a combined optical-PET (OPET) system were explored by simulating its image formation process. A micro-MRI based virtual mouse phantom was assigned appropriate tissue optical properties to each of its segmented internal organs at wavelengths spanning the emission spectrum of the firefly luciferase at 37 degrees C. The TOAST finite-element code was employed to simulate the diffuse transport of photons emitted from bioluminescence sources in the mouse. OPET measurements were simulated for single-point, two-point and distributed bioluminescence sources located in different organs such as the liver, the kidneys and the gut. An expectation maximization code was employed to recover the intensity and location of these simulated sources. It was found that spectrally resolved measurements were necessary in order to perform tomographic bioluminescence imaging. The true location of emission sources could be recovered if the mouse background optical properties were known a priori. The assumption of a homogeneous optical property background proved inadequate for describing photon transport in optically heterogeneous tissues and led to inaccurate source localization in the reconstructed images. The simulation results pointed out specific methodological challenges that need to be addressed before a practical implementation of OPET-based bioluminescence tomography is achieved.},

abstract = {A method for inverting measurements made on the surfaces of tissues for recovery of interior optical property maps is demonstrated for sparse near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence measurement sets on large tissue-simulating volumes with highly variable signal-to-noise ratio. A Bayesian minimum-variance reconstruction algorithm compensates for the spatial variability in signal-to-noise ratio that must be expected to occur in actual NIR contrast-enhanced diagnostic medical imaging. Image reconstruction is demonstrated by using frequency-domain photon migration measurements on 256-cm(3) tissue-mimicking phantoms containing none, one, or two 1-cm(3) heterogeneities with 50- to 100-fold greater concentration of Indocyanine Green dye over background levels. The spatial parameter estimate of absorption owing to the dye was reconstructed from only 160 to 296 surface measurements of emission light at 830 nm in response to incident 785-nm excitation light modulated at 100 MHz. Measurement error of acquired fluence at fluorescent emission wavelengths is shown to be highly variable. Convergence and quality of image reconstructions are improved by Bayesian conditioning incorporating (i) experimentally determined measurement error variance, (ii) recursively updated estimates of parameter uncertainty, and (iii) dynamic zonation. The results demonstrate that, to employ NIR fluorescence-enhanced optical imaging for large volumes, reconstruction approaches must account for the large range of signal-to-noise ratio associated with the measurements.},

In this paper, a penalized linear and nonlinear combined conjugate gradient method for the reconstruction of fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is presented. The algorithm combines the linear conjugate gradient method and the nonlinear conjugate gradient method together based on a restart strategy, in order to take advantage of the two kinds of conjugate gradient methods and compensate for the disadvantages. A quadratic penalty method is adopted to gain a nonnegative constraint and reduce the illposedness of the problem. Simulation studies show that the presented algorithm is accurate, stable, and fast. It has a better performance than the conventional conjugate gradient-based reconstruction algorithms. It offers an effective approach to reconstruct fluorochrome information for FMT.},

abstract = {Two one-speed radiation transport equations coupled by a dynamic equation for the distribution of fluorophore electronic states are used to model the migration of excitation photons and emitted fluorescence photons. The conditions for producing appreciable levels of fluorophore in the excited state are studied, with the conclusion that minimal saturation occurs under the conditions applicable to tissue imaging. This simplifies the derivation of the frequency response and of the imaging operator for a time-harmonic excitation source. Several factors known to influence the fluorescence response-the concentration, mean lifetime and quantum yield of the fluorophore, and the modulation frequency of the excitatory source-are examined. Optimal sensitivity conditions are obtained by analyzing the fluorescence source strength as a function of the mean lifetime and modulation frequency. The dependence of demodulation of the fluorescent signal on the above factors is also examined. In complementary studies, transport-theory-based operators for imaging fluorophore distributions in a highly scattering medium are derived. Experimental data were collected by irradiating a cylindrical phantom containing one or two fluorophore-filled balloons with continuous wave laser light. The reconstruction results show that qualitatively and quantitatively good images can be obtained, with embedded objects accurately located and the fluorophore concentration correctly determined.},

Currently, there is an increasingly pressing need for simulating tools more powerful than MCML in order to study light propagation phenomena in complex inhomogeneous objects, such as the mouse. Here we report a tetrahedron-based inhomogeneous Monte Carlo optical simulator (TIM-OS) to address this issue. By modeling an object as a tetrahedron-based inhomogeneous finite-element mesh, TIM-OS can determine the photon-triangle interaction recursively and rapidly.

An immunofluorescent cell-based assay was used to evaluate specificity and sensitivity of the conjugate in cultured cell monolayers. Dose-dependent uptake was established with increasing concentrations of IRDye 800CW 2-DG for epithelial and prostate carcinomas. IRDye 800CW 2-DG was specifically blocked by an antibody against GLUT1 glucose transporter, and by excess unlabeled 2-DG or d-glucose. Signal was increased by a phorbol ester activator of glucose transport. Fluorescence microscopy data confirmed localization of the conjugate in the cytoplasm. Subsequent in vivo studies optimized dose, clearance, and timing for signal capture in nude mouse xenografts. In all cases, tumors were clearly imaged with good signal-to-noise characteristics. These data indicate that IRDye 800CW 2-DG is a broadly applicable optical imaging agent for in vivo imaging of neoplasms in mice.},

The Pl\"{u}cker-coordinate ray-polygon intersection test can be extended to hexahedral or high-order elements. Excellent agreement is found when comparing mesh-based MC with the analytical diffusion model and 3D voxel-based MC code in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. Realistic time-resolved imaging results are observed for a complex human brain anatomy using mesh-based MC.

We also address effects caused by void-like heterogeneities in which absorption and scattering are very small compared with the surrounding medium.

abstract = {2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) has extensively been used for clinical diagnosis, staging, and therapy monitoring of cancer and other diseases. Nonradioactive glucose analogues enabling the screening of the glucose metabolic rate of tumors are of particular interest for anticancer drug development. A nonradioactive fluorescent deoxyglucose analogue may have many applications for both imaging of tumors and monitoring therapeutic efficacy of drugs in living animals and may eventually translate to clinical applications. We found that a fluorescent 2-deoxyglucose analogue, 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-NBDG), can be delivered in several tumor cells via the glucose transporters (GLUTs). We therefore conjugated D-glucosamine with a near-infrared (NIR) fluorphor Cy5.5 and tested the feasibility of the Cy5.5-D-glucosamine (Cy5.5-2DG) conjugate for NIR fluorescence imaging of tumors in a preclinical xenograft animal model. Cy5.5-2DG was prepared by conjugating Cy5.5 monofunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Cy5.5-NHS) and D-glucosamine followed by high-performance liquid chromatography purification. The accumulation of Cy5.5-2DG and Cy5.5-NHS in different tumor cell lines at 37 and 4 degrees C were imaged using a fluorescence microscope. Tumor targeting and retention of Cy5.5-2DG and Cy5.5-NHS in a subcutaneous U87MG glioma and A375M melanoma tumor model were evaluated and quantified by a Xenogen IVIS 200 optical cooled charged-coupled device system. Fluorescence microscopy imaging shows that Cy5.5-2DG and Cy5.5-NHS are taken up and trapped by a variety of tumor cell lines at 37 degrees C incubation, while they exhibit marginal uptake at 4 degrees C. The tumor cell uptake of Cy5.5-2DG cannot be blocked by the 50 mM D-glucose, suggesting that Cy5.5-2DG may not be delivered in tumor cells by GLUTs. U87MG and A375M tumor localization was clearly visualized in living mice with both NIR fluorescent probes. Tumor/muscle contrast was clearly visible as early as 30 min postinjection (pi), and the highest U87MG tumor/muscle ratios of 2.81 +/- 0.10 and 3.34 +/- 0.23 were achieved 24 h pi for Cy5.5-2DG and Cy5.5-NHS, respectively. While as a comparison, the micropositron emission tomography imaging study shows that [18F]FDG preferentially localizes to the U87MG tumor, with resulting tumor/muscle ratios ranging from 3.89 to 4.08 after 30 min to 2 h postadministration of the probe. In conclusion, the NIR fluorescent glucose analogues, Cy5.5-2DG and Cy5.5-NHS, both demonstrate tumor-targeting abilities in cell culture and living mice. More studies are warranted to further explore their application for optical tumor imaging. To develop NIR glucose analogues with the ability to target GLUTs/hexokinase, it is highly important to select NIR dyes with a reasonable molecular size.},

However, none of the current imaging methods used in humans provides comprehensive medical imaging. To harness the strengths of different imaging methods, multimodality imaging has become an attractive strategy for in vivo studies. Beyond small-animal imaging, a less frequently used multimodality imaging strategy is the fusion of radionuclear and optical methods. This less frequent use is probably attributable to some misconceptions, technical difficulties, or a lack of appreciation for the benefits of the 2 methods in patient care. This minireview addresses some of these concerns, with emphasis on the potential applications of multimodality optical and SPECT/PET systems.},

abstract = {Optical tomography attempts to determine a spatially variable coefficient in the interior of a body from measurements of light fluxes at the boundary. Like in many other applications in biomedical imaging, computing solutions in optical tomography is complicated by the fact that one wants to identify an unknown number of relatively small irregularities in this coefficient at unknown locations, for example corresponding to the presence of tumors. To recover them at the resolution needed in clinical practice, one has to use meshes that, if uniformly fine, would lead to intractably large problems with hundreds of millions of unknowns. Adaptive meshes are therefore an indispensable tool. In this paper, we will describe a framework for the adaptive finite element solution of optical tomography problems. It takes into account all steps starting from the formulation of the problem including constraints on the coefficient, outer Newton-type nonlinear and inner linear iterations, regularization, and in particular the interplay of these algorithms with discretizing the problem on a sequence of adaptively refined meshes. We will demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these algorithms on a set of numerical examples of clinical relevance related to locating lymph nodes in tumor diagnosis.},

However, curved optical interfaces and a highly heterogeneous internal structure make quantitative fluorescence imaging of the murine brain a particularly challenging tomographic problem. We investigated the integration of X-ray computed tomography (CT) information into a state-of-the-art fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) scheme and establish that the dual-modality approach is essential for high fidelity reconstructions of distributed fluorescence within the murine brain, as compared to conventional fluorescence tomography. We employ this method in vivo using a fluorescent oxazine dye to quantify amyloid-beta plaque burden in transgenic APP23 mice modeling Alzheimer's disease. Multi-modal imaging allows for accurate signal localization and correlation of in vivo findings to ex vivo studies. The results point to FMT-CT as an essential tool for in vivo study of neurodegenerative disease in animal models and potentially humans.},

abstract = {Breast cancer cells are known to overexpress Glut5, a sugar transporter responsible for the transfer of fructose across the cell membrane. Since Glut5 transporter is not significantly expressed in normal breast cells, fructose uptake can potentially be used to differentiate between normal and cancerous cells. Fructose was labeled with two fluorophores at the C-1 position: 7-nitro-1,2,3-benzadiazole (NBD) and Cy5.5. The labeling site was chosen on the basis of the presence and substrate specificity of the key proteins involved in the first steps of fructose metabolism. Using fluorescence microscopy, the uptake of the probes was studied in three breast cancer cell lines: MCF 7, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-231. Both fluorescent fructose derivatives showed a very good uptake in all tested cell lines. The level of uptake was comparable to that of the corresponding glucose analogs, 2-NBDG and Cy5.5-DG. Significant uptake of 1-NBDF derivative was not observed in cells lacking Glut5 transporter, while the uptake of the 1-Cy5.5-DF derivative was independent of the presence of a fructose-specific transporter. While 1-NBDF showed Glut5-specific accumulation, the coupling of a large fluorophore such as Cy5.5 likely introduces big structural and electronic changes, leading to a fructose derivative that does not accurately describe the uptake of fructose in cells.},

The system comprises an optical imaging setup for in vivo bioluminescence and fluorescence detection, as well as an x-ray CT, both mounted on a common rotatable gantry enabling fully simultaneous imaging at axially overlapping fields-of-view. Geometric co-calibration is performed once by imaging a single cylindrical light-emitting source with both modalities over 360 degrees at two axial positions, respectively. Given the three-dimensional coordinates of the source positions in the reconstructed CT volume data along with their two-dimensional locations projected at the optical detector plane, the following intrinsic system parameters are calculated: (i) the intrinsic geometric parameters of the optical detection system-five parameters for each view and (ii) the relative positional relationship between the optical and CT systems-two parameters for each view. After co-calibration is performed, experimental studies using phantoms demonstrate the high degree of intrinsic positional accuracy between the optical and CT measurements. The most important advantage of this approach is that dual-modal data fusion is accomplished without any post-registration strategies.},

abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) poses a typical ill-posed inverse problem with a limited number of measurements and inherently low spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach to improve spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy by using a priori information provided by a secondary high resolution anatomical imaging modality, such as magnetic resonance (MR) or x-ray. In such a dual imaging approach, while the correlation between optical and anatomical images may be high, it is not perfect. For example, a tumour may be present in the optical image, but may not be discernable in the anatomical image. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian approach allows incorporation of partial a priori knowledge about the noise and unknown optical image models, thereby capturing the function-anatomy correlation effectively. We present a computationally efficient iterative algorithm to simultaneously estimate the optical image and the unknown a priori model parameters. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method avoids undesirable bias towards anatomical prior information and leads to significantly improved spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy.},

In this paper, we establish a direct linear relationship between measured surface photon density and an unknown bioluminescence source distribution by using a finite-element method based on the diffusion approximation to the photon propagation in biological tissue. We develop a novel reconstruction algorithm to recover the source distribution. This algorithm incorporates a priori knowledge to define the permissible source region in order to enhance numerical stability and efficiency. Simulations with a numerical mouse chest phantom demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed BLT algorithm and reveal its performance in terms of source location, density, and robustness against noise. Lastly, BLT experiments are performed to identify the location and power of two light sources in a physical mouse chest phantom.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Mice are an increasingly important tool in ophthalmic research. As a result of studying spontaneous and induced mutations, many new ocular diseases have been described in mice in recent years, including several degenerative retinal diseases that demonstrate progression with age. Clearly, documentation of progressive changes in clinical phenotype is an important facet of characterizing new mutations and for comparing them with human diseases. Despite these facts, there are few published photographs of mouse fundi. The small size of the mouse eye and the steep curvature of its structures have made it difficult to obtain high quality fundus photographs. The purpose of this work was to develop procedures for mouse fundus photography and angiography and to use these techniques to examine several new mouse strains with ocular abnormalities. METHODS: We have used a small animal fundus camera and condensing lens to develop a reliable technique for producing high quality fundus images of conscious albino and pigmented mice. The fundus camera also was utilized to develop a method for fluorescein angiography, which demonstrated the normal retinal vascular bed as well as abnormal vascular leakage. In addition, several mouse strains with previously unreported ocular abnormalities (including two with inherited optic nerve colobomas) and a catalogue of previously unpublished clinical images for various mutant mice are presented. RESULTS: Altogether, we provide clinical images for C57BL/6J, BALB/cByJ, retinal degeneration 1 (rd1), Rd2, rd3, rd7, achondroplasia, nervous, motor neuron degeneration, Purkinje cell degeneration, kidney and retinal defects, optic nerve coloboma 1, and two apparently multigenic optic nerve colobomas in a strain of mixed derivation (ONC) and the inbred CALB/Rk strain. CONCLUSIONS: Our photography procedure reliably produces high quality images of the mouse fundus. This permitted us to record progressive retinal changes over time in the same animal, allowed us to compare the phenotypes of newly discovered retinal mutants to existing mutants at other institutions and to potentially similar human conditions, and finally, permitted us to produce a catalogue of previously unpublished clinical phenotypes for various mutant mice.},

abstract = {Intraoperative visual fluorescence imaging (vFI) has emerged as a promising aid to surgical guidance, but does not fully exploit the potential of the fluorescent agents that are currently available. Here, we introduce a quantitative fluorescence imaging (qFI) approach that converts spectrally-resolved data into images of absolute fluorophore concentration pixel-by-pixel across the surgical field of view (FOV). The resulting estimates are linear, accurate, and precise relative to true values, and spectral decomposition of multiple fluorophores is also achieved. Experiments with protoporphyrin IX in a glioma rodent model demonstrate in vivo quantitative and spectrally-resolved fluorescence imaging of infiltrating tumor margins for the first time. Moreover, we present images from human surgery which detect residual tumor not evident with state-of-the-art vFI. The wide-field qFI technique has broad implications for intraoperative surgical guidance because it provides near real-time quantitative assessment of multiple fluorescent biomarkers across the operative field.},

abstract = {Erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) has been used for more than 30 years as an indicator of lead intoxication, iron deficiency, and porphyrias. Recently, numerous analytical problems associated with various EP methods have been reported, including a lack of consensus among investigators regarding the best calibration material or analytical procedure. We investigated commercially available protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) standard materials and measured the millimolar absorptivity (m epsilon) of these materials, focusing on variables affecting the determination of their absorptivities. Among the five forms of PPIX available, PPIX dimethyl ester, when hydrolyzed to PPIX free acid, gave the most consistent and reproducible results. This work confirmed our earlier observations, made on more than 600 separate occasions during 12 years, that the m epsilon of PPIX free acid in 1.5 mol/L HCl at the Soret maximum is 297 +/- 1.3 L.mmol-1.cm-1, 19\% higher than the arbitrary value of 241 L.mmol-1.cm-1 generally accepted by most investigators but based on unpublished data. We propose that the m epsilon of 297 L.mmol-1.cm-1 for PPIX be adopted and that PPIX dimethyl ester be used for the calibration of acid-extraction methods. A detailed protocol for the preparation and verification of PPIX from the dimethyl ester is available upon request.},

abstract = {Purpose: Invisible near-infrared light is safe and it penetrates relatively deeply through tissue and blood without altering the surgical field. Our hypothesis was that near-infrared fluorescence imaging would enable visualization of the ureteral anatomy and flow intraoperatively and in real time. Materials and Methods: CW800-CA (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska), the carboxylic acid form of near-infrared fluorophore IRDye™ 800CW, was injected intravenously, and its renal clearance kinetics and imaging performance were quantified in 350 gm rats and 35 kg pigs. High performance liquid chromatography and electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used to characterize CW800-CA metabolism in urine. The clinically available near-infrared fluorophore indocyanine green was also used via retrograde injection into the ureter. Using the 2 near-infrared fluorophores the ureters were imaged under the conditions of steady state, intraluminal foreign bodies and injury. Results: In rat models the highest signal-to-background ratio for visualization occurred after intravenous injection of 7.5 $\mu$g/kg CW800-CA with values of 4.0 or greater and 2.3 or greater at 10 and 30 minutes, respectively. In pig models 7.5 $\mu$g/kg CW800-CA clearly visualized the normal ureter and intraluminal foreign bodies as small as 2.5 mm in diameter. Retrograde injection of 10 $\mu$M indocyanine green also permitted the detection of normal ureter and pinpointed urine leakage caused by injury. Electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and absorbance and fluorescence spectral analysis confirmed that the fluorescent material in urine was chemically identical to CW800-CA. Conclusions: A convenient intravenous injection of CW800-CA or direct injection of indocyanine green permits high sensitivity visualization of the ureters under steady state and abnormal conditions using invisible light. © 2007 American Urological Association.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to show that novel photodynamic therapy (PDT) sensitizers can be activated by two-photon absorption in the near-IR region of the spectrum and to show, for the first time, that such activation can lead to tumor regressions at significant tissue depth. These experiments also evaluated effects of high-energy femtosecond pulsed laser irradiation on normal tissues and characterized the response of xenograft tumors to our PDT protocols.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human small cell lung cancer (NCI-H69), non-small cell lung cancer (A549), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) xenografts were induced in SCID mice. Irradiation of sensitized tumors was undertaken through the bodies of tumor-bearing mice to give a treatment depth of 2 cm. Posttreatment tumor regressions and histopathology were carried out to determine the nature of the response to these new PDT agents. Microarray expression profiles were conducted to assess the similarity of responses to single and two-photon activated PDT.

RESULTS: Regressions of all tumor types tested were seen. Histopathology was consistent with known PDT effects, and no, or minimal, changes were noted in irradiated normal tissues. Cluster analysis of microarray expression profiling showed reproducible changes in transcripts associated with apoptosis, stress, oxygen transport, and gene regulation.

CONCLUSIONS: These new PDT sensitizers can be used at a depth of 2 cm to produce excellent xenograft regressions. The tumor response was consistent with known responses to single-photon activated PDT. Experiments in larger animals are warranted to determine the maximal achievable depth of treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: 5-Aminolevulinic acid is a non-fluorescent prodrug that leads to intracellular accumulation of fluorescent porphyrins in malignant gliomas-a finding that is under investigation for intraoperative identification and resection of these tumours. We aimed to assess the effect of fluorescence-guided resection with 5-aminolevulinic acid on surgical radicality, progression-free survival, overall survival, and morbidity.

METHODS: 322 patients aged 23-73 years with suspected malignant glioma amenable to complete resection of contrast-enhancing tumour were randomly assigned to 20 mg/kg bodyweight 5-aminolevulinic acid for fluorescence-guided resection (n=161) or to conventional microsurgery with white light (n=161). The primary endpoints were the number of patients without contrast-enhancing tumour on early MRI (ie, that obtained within 72 h after surgery) and 6-month progression-free survival as assessed by MRI. Secondary endpoints were volume of residual tumour on postoperative MRI, overall survival, neurological deficit, and toxic effects. We report the results of an interim analysis with 270 patients in the full-analysis population (139 assigned 5-aminolevulinic acid, 131 assigned white light), which excluded patients with ineligible histological and radiological findings as assessed by central reviewers who were masked as to treatment allocation; the interim analysis resulted in termination of the study as defined by the protocol. Primary and secondary endpoints were analysed by intention to treat in the full-analysis population. The study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00241670.

FINDINGS: Median follow-up was 35.4 months (95\% CI 1.0-56.7). Contrast-enhancing tumour was resected completely in 90 (65\%) of 139 patients assigned 5-aminolevulinic acid compared with 47 (36\%) of 131 assigned white light (difference between groups 29\% [95\% CI 17-40], p<0.0001). Patients allocated 5-aminolevulinic acid had higher 6-month progression free survival than did those allocated white light (41.0\% [32.8-49.2] vs 21.1\% [14.0-28.2]; difference between groups 19.9\% [9.1-30.7], p=0.0003, Z test). Groups did not differ in the frequency of severe adverse events or adverse events in any organ system class reported within 7 days after surgery.

INTERPRETATION: Tumour fluorescence derived from 5-aminolevulinic acid enables more complete resections of contrast-enhancing tumour, leading to improved progression-free survival in patients with malignant glioma.},

abstract = {Photodynamic diagnosis is a modern method for the fluorescence imaging of superficial pharyngeal and laryngeal tumours. 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-induced protoporphyrin IX fluorescence benefits the tumour selective accumulation of protoporphyrin; therefore, tumours can be differentiated from healthy tissue. ALA-induced fluorescence of laryngo-pharyngeal tumours and precancerous and benign lesions were evaluated by endoscopy. At the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Szeged, Hungary, 31 patients underwent ALA-induced protoporphyrin fluorescence imaging. After topical application of ALA, mesopharyngeal tumours were visualised by direct fluorescence endoscopy. Laryngeal and hypopharyngeal tumours were examined with a laryngomicroscope with the patients under general anaesthesia after inhalation of an ALA solution. Intensity of PPIX fluorescence was classified and compared with pathological findings. The examination of all 13 laryngeal and 12 pharyngeal tumours resulted in a middle or strong intensity of red fluorescence, but for one cancer, four precancerous and two benign lesions. Healthy tissues showed green autofluorescence. Margins of mesopharyngeal and vocal cord tumours were clearly outlined under fluorescent vision, giving a helpful contribution to diagnosis and therapy even in clinically non-visible tumours. Laryngomicroscopy combined with laser surgery also indicated PPIX fluorescence examination visualising margins of the tumour intermediately with the endoscope. The ALA-induced PPIX fluorescence imaging method revealed a sensitivity of 96\%.

abstract = {Purpose: Radiological imaging is the mainstay of diagnosing ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Current established radiological modalities can potentially differentiate the varying degrees of obstruction but they are limited in functionality, applicability and/or comprehensiveness. Of particular concern is that some tests require radiation, which has long-term consequences, especially in children. Materials and Methods: We investigated the novel use of Genhance??? 680 dynamic fluorescence imaging to assess ureteropelvic junction obstruction in 20 mice that underwent partial or complete unilateral ureteral obstruction. Ultrasound, mercaptoacetyltriglycine renography, magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescence imaging were performed. Results: Our model of partial and complete obstruction could be distinguished by ultrasound, mercaptoacetyltriglycine renography and magnetic resonance imaging, and was confirmed by histological analysis. Using fluorescence imaging distinct vascular and urinary parameters were identified in the partial and complete obstruction groups compared to controls. Conclusions: Fluorescence imaging is a feasible alternative radiological imaging modality to diagnose ureteropelvic junction obstruction. It provides continuous, detailed imaging without the risk of radiation exposure. ?? 2011 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.},

abstract = {Detection of intrinsic or extrinsically administered chromophores and photo-absorbing nanoparticles has been achieved by Multi-Spectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT). The detection sensitivity of MSOT depends not only on the signal to noise ratio considerations, as in conventional optoacoustic (photoacoustic) tomography implementations, but also on the ability to resolve the molecular targets of interest from the absorbing tissue background by means of spectral un-mixing or sub-pixel detection methods. However, it is not known which un-mixing methods are optimally suited for the characteristics of multispectral optoacoustic images. In this work we investigated the performance of different sub-pixel detection methods, typically used in remote sensing hyperspectral imaging, within the context of MSOT. A quantitative comparison of the different algorithmic approaches was carried out in an effort to identify methods that operate optimally under the particulars of MSOT applications. We find that statistical sub-pixel detection methods can demonstrate a unique detection performance with up to five times enhanced sensitivity as compared to linear un-mixing approximations, under the condition that the optical agent of interest is sparsely present within the tissue volume, as common when using targeted agents and reporter genes.},

abstract = {The completeness of tumor removal during surgery is dependent on the surgeon's ability to differentiate tumor from normal tissue using subjective criteria that are not easily quantifiable. A way to objectively assess tumor margins during surgery in patients would be of great value. We have developed a method to visualize tumors during surgery using activatable cell-penetrating peptides (ACPPs), in which the fluorescently labeled, polycationic cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) is coupled via a cleavable linker to a neutralizing peptide. Upon exposure to proteases characteristic of tumor tissue, the linker is cleaved, dissociating the inhibitory peptide and allowing the CPP to bind to and enter tumor cells. In mice, xenografts stably transfected with green fluorescent protein show colocalization with the Cy5-labeled ACPPs. In the same mouse models, Cy5-labeled free ACPPs and ACPPs conjugated to dendrimers (ACPPDs) delineate the margin between tumor and adjacent tissue, resulting in improved precision of tumor resection. Surgery guided by ACPPD resulted in fewer residual cancer cells left in the animal after surgery as measured by Alu PCR. A single injection of ACPPD dually labeled with Cy5 and gadolinium chelates enabled preoperative whole-body tumor detection by MRI, intraoperative guidance by real-time fluorescence, intraoperative histological analysis of margin status by fluorescence, and postoperative MRI tumor quantification. Animals whose tumors were resected with ACPPD guidance had better long-term tumor-free survival and overall survival than animals whose tumors were resected with traditional bright-field illumination only.},

abstract = {The instantaneous noise-free linear mixing model in independent component analysis is largely a solved problem under the usual assumption of independent nongaussian sources and full column rank mixing matrix. However, with some prior information on the sources, like positivity, new analysis and perhaps simplified solution methods may yet become possible. In this letter, we consider the task of independent component analysis when the independent sources are known to be nonnegative and well grounded, which means that they have a nonzero pdf in the region of zero. It can be shown that in this case, the solution method is basically very simple: an orthogonal rotation of the whitened observation vector into nonnegative outputs will give a positive permutation of the original sources. We propose a cost function whose minimum coincides with nonnegativity and derive the gradient algorithm under the whitening constraint, under which the separating matrix is orthogonal. We further prove that in the Stiefel manifold of orthogonal matrices, the cost function is a Lyapunov function for the matrix gradient flow, implying global convergence. Thus, this algorithm is guaranteed to find the nonnegative well-grounded independent sources. The analysis is complemented by a numerical simulation, which illustrates the algorithm.},

abstract = {Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) offers a cost-effective means to image blood flow in vivo. However, it is not commonly used to image rodent retinas because of the challenges associated with imaging through the curved cornea and delivering light through the highly scattering lens. A solution to overcome these problems by using LSCI in conjunction with an endoscope to obtain high spatiotemporal blood flow images is described. Its utility is demonstrated by imaging blood flow changes in rat retinas using hyperoxic, hypercapnic, and visual (flicker) stimulations. Hypercapnia increases blood flow, hyperoxia decreases blood flow, and visual stimulation increases blood flow in the retina relative to basal conditions. The time-to-peak of the LSCI response to visual stimulation is also measured. This approach may prove useful to investigate dysregulation in blood flow-evoked responses in retinal diseases and to evaluate treatment strategies in rodents.},

abstract = {Oxygenation measurements are widely used in patient care. However, most clinically available instruments currently consist of contact probes that only provide global monitoring of the patient (e.g., pulse oximetry probes) or local monitoring of small areas (e.g., spectroscopy-based probes). Visualization of oxygenation over large areas of tissue, without a priori knowledge of the location of defects, has the potential to improve patient management in many surgical and critical care applications. In this study, we present a clinically compatible multispectral spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) system optimized for surgical oxygenation imaging. This system was used to image tissue oxygenation over a large area (16×12 cm) and was validated during preclinical studies by comparing results obtained with an FDA-approved clinical oxygenation probe. Skin flap, bowel, and liver vascular occlusion experiments were performed on Yorkshire pigs and demonstrated that over the course of the experiment, relative changes in oxygen saturation measured using SFDI had an accuracy within 10\% of those made using the FDA-approved device. Finally, the new SFDI system was translated to the clinic in a first-in-human pilot study that imaged skin flap oxygenation during reconstructive breast surgery. Overall, this study lays the foundation for clinical translation of endogenous contrast imaging using SFDI.},

However at present, it has yet to be shown that this method is able to identify infiltrative component of glioma. In extracted tumor tissues we measured a two-peaked emission in low grade gliomas and in the infiltrative component of glioblastomas due to multiple photochemical states of PpIX. The second emission peak appearing at 620 nm (shifted by 14 nm from the main peak at 634 nm) limits the sensibility of current methods to measured PpIX concentration. We propose new measured parameters, by taking into consideration the two-peaked emission, to overcome these limitations in sensitivity. These parameters clearly distinguish the solid component of glioblastomas from low grade gliomas and infiltrative component of glioblastomas.},

abstract = {We propose a novel imaging system useful in dermatology, more precisely, for the follow-up of patients with an increased risk of skin cancer. The system consists of a Pentium PC equipped with an RGB frame grabber, a three-chip charge coupled devices (CCD) camera controlled by the serial port and equipped with a zoom lens and a halogen annular light source. Calibration of the imaging system provides a way to transform the acquired images, which are defined in an unknown color space, to a standard, well-defined color space called sRGB. sRGB has a known relation to the CIE1 XYZ and CIE L*a*b* colorimetric spaces. These CIE color spaces are based on the human vision, and they allow the computation of a color difference metric called CIE deltaE*ab, which is proportional to the color difference, as seen by a human observer. Several types of polynomial RGB to sRGB transforms will be tried, including some optimized in perceptually uniform color spaces. The use of a standard and well-defined color space also allows meaningful exchange of images, e.g., in teledermatology. The calibration procedure is based on 24 patches with known color properties, and it takes about 5 minutes to perform. It results in a number of settings called a profile that remains valid for tens of hours of operation. Such a profile is checked before acquiring images using just one color patch, and is adjusted on the fly to compensate for short-term drift in the response of the imaging system. Precision or reproducibility of subsequent color measurements is very good with (deltaE*ab) = 0.3 and deltaE*ab < 1.2. Accuracy compared with spectrophotometric measurements is fair with (deltaE*ab) = 6.2 and deltaE*ab < 13.3.},

abstract = {Although the modern surgical era is highlighted by multiple technological advances and innovations, one area that has remained constant is the dependence of the surgeon's vision on white-light reflectance. This renders different body tissues in a limited palette of various shades of pink and red, thereby limiting the visual contrast available to the operating surgeon. Healthy tissue, anatomic variations, and diseased states are seen as slight discolorations relative to each other and differences are inherently limited in dynamic range. In the upcoming years, surgery will undergo a paradigm shift with the use of targeted fluorescence imaging probes aimed at augmenting the surgical armamentarium by expanding the "visible" spectrum available to surgeons. Such fluorescent "smart probes" will provide real-time, intraoperative, pseudo-color, high-contrast delineation of both normal and pathologic tissues. Fluorescent surgical molecular guidance promises another major leap forward to improve patient safety and clinical outcomes, and to reduce overall healthcare costs. This review provides an overview of current and future surgical applications of fluorescence imaging in diseased and nondiseased tissues and focus on the innovative fields of image processing and instrumentation.},

In this study, we generated CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice on the C57BL/6J background. Retinal degeneration was not detected in CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice younger than 6 months. Patches of whitish/yellowish fundus lesions were observed in 17∼60\% of 12-month, and 30∼100\% of 18-month CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice. Fluorescein angiography revealed no choroidal neovascularisation in these mice. Patches of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor damage were detected in 30\% and 50\% of 12- and 18-month CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice respectively, but not in wild-type mice. All CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice exposed to extra-light (∼800lux, 6 h/day, 6 months) developed patches of retinal atrophy, and only 20-25\% of WT mice which underwent the same light treatment developed atrophic lesions. In addition, synaptophysin expression was detected in the outer nucler layer (ONL) of area related to photoreceptor loss in CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice. Markedly increased rhodopsin but reduced cone arrestin expression was observed in retinal outer layers in aged CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice. GABA expression was reduced in the inner retina of aged CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice. Significantly increased M\"{u}ller glial and microglial activation was observed in CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice compared to age-matched WT mice. Macrophages from CCL2(-/-)CX3CR1(GFP/GFP) mice were less phagocytic, but expressed higher levels of iNOS, IL-1$\beta$, IL-12 and TNF-$\alpha$ under hypoxia conditions. Our results suggest that the deletions of CCL2 and CX3CR1 predispose mice to age- and light-mediated retinal damage. The CCL2/CX3CR1 deficient mouse may thus serve as a model for age-related atrophic degeneration of the RPE, including the dry type of macular degeneration, geographic atrophy.},

The region of interest is illuminated with near-IR light and the emitted back fluorescence is analyzed to localize the fluorescence sources. To investigate a thick medium, as the fluorescence signal decreases with the light travel distance, any disturbing signal, such as biological tissues intrinsic fluorescence (called autofluorescence) is a limiting factor. Several specific markers may also be simultaneously injected to bind to different molecules, and one may want to isolate each specific fluorescent signal from the others. To remove the unwanted fluorescence contributions or separate different specific markers, a spectroscopic approach is explored. The nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the blind positive source separation method we chose. We run an original regularized NMF algorithm we developed on experimental data, and successfully obtain separated in vivo fluorescence spectra.},

abstract = {We present a clinical investigation of diffuse reflectance and time-resolved autofluorescence spectra of skin cancer with an emphasis on basal cell carcinoma. A total of 25 patients were measured using a compact steady-state diffuse reflectance/fluorescence spectrometer and a fibre-optic-coupled multispectral time-resolved spectrofluorometer. Measurements were performed in vivo prior to surgical excision of the investigated region. Singular value decomposition was used to reduce the dimensionality of steady state diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectra. Linear discriminant analysis was then applied to the measurements of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and used to predict the tissue disease state with a leave-one-out methodology. This approach was able to correctly diagnose 87\% of the BCCs. With 445 nm excitation a decrease in the spectrally averaged fluorescence lifetime was observed between normal tissue and BCC lesions with a mean value of 886 ps. Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetime for BCCs was lower than that of the surrounding healthy tissue in all cases and statistical analysis of the data revealed that this decrease was significant (p = 0.002).},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The authors recently used topical endoscopy to image the mouse eye fundus. Here, they widened the field of application for this ophthalmologic tool, imaging both the posterior and the anterior eye segments in larger animals commonly encountered in research laboratories and veterinary clinics. METHODS: Pupils were dilated, and local anesthetic and gel were applied to the animal cornea. The endoscopic probe was placed in contact with the cornea of conscious rats, sedated cats and dogs, anesthetized sheep, and nonhuman primates. RESULTS: High-resolution digital images of the eye fundus were obtained in all investigated animals using the endoscopic probe along the eye axis. Arteriovenous filling time was monitored with fluorescein angiography in pigmented rats. The retinal periphery and ciliary bodies could be visualized with the probe placed at an oblique angle. The probe was inclined further to observe the iridocorneal angle such that the pectinate ligaments could be seen at high resolution in cats. The authors used the probe on eyes with retinal detachment, luxation of a cataractous lens, and pigment infiltration in the iridocorneal angle, demonstrating its potential use in eye diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This topical endoscopic technique provides a unique tool for single eye examinations. The authors obtained a circular view of the anterior (iridocorneal angle) and the posterior (fundus) eye segments from all animal species studied. This technique is inexpensive and easy to use. It can be easily moved to the eye of the patient who cannot move to stand in front of classic apparatus, offering new opportunities in ophthalmology.},

abstract = {Fluorescence imaging in neurosurgery has a long historical development, with several different biomarkers and biochemical agents being used, and several technological approaches. This review focuses on the different contrast agents, summarizing endogenous fluorescence, exogenously stimulated fluorescence and exogenous contrast agents, and then on tools used for imaging. It ends with a summary of key clinical trials that lead to consensus studies. The practical utility of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) as stimulated by administration of $\delta$-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has had substantial pilot clinical studies and basic science research completed. Recently multi-center clinical trials using PpIx fluorescence to guide resection have shown efficacy for improved short term survival. Exogenous agents are being developed and tested pre-clinically, and hopefully hold the potential for long term survival benefit if they provide additional capabilities for resection of micro-invasive disease or certain tumor sub-types that do not produce PpIX or help delineate low grade tumors. The range of technologies used for measurement and imaging ranges widely, with most clinical trials being carried out with either point probes or modified surgical microscopes. At this point in time, optimized probe approaches are showing efficacy in clinical trials, and fully commercialized imaging systems are emerging, which will clearly help lead to adoption into neurosurgical practice.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze high-resolution color photographs of the mouse fundus.

METHODS: A contact fundus camera based on topical endoscopy fundus imaging (TEFI) was built. Fundus photographs of C57 and Balb/c mice obtained by TEFI were qualitatively analyzed.

RESULTS: High-resolution digital imaging of the fundus, including the ciliary body, was routinely obtained. The reflectance and contrast of retinal vessels varied significantly with the amount of incident and reflected light and, thus, with the degree of fundus pigmentation. The combination of chromatic and spherical aberration favored blue light imaging, in term of both field and contrast.

CONCLUSIONS: TEFI is a small, low-cost system that allows high-resolution color fundus imaging and fluorescein angiography in conscious mice. Panretinal imaging is facilitated by the presence of the large rounded lens. TEFI significantly improves the quality of in vivo photography of retina and ciliary process of mice. Resolution is, however, affected by chromatic aberration, and should be improved by monochromatic imaging.},

abstract = {Healthcare-associated infections (HCAI/HAI) represent a substantial threat to patient health during hospitalization and incur billions of dollars additional cost for subsequent treatment. One promising method for the detection of bacterial contamination in a clinical setting before an HAI outbreak occurs is to exploit native fluorescence of cellular molecules for a hand-held, rapid-sweep surveillance instrument. Previous studies have shown fluorescence-based detection to be sensitive and effective for food-borne and environmental microorganisms, and even to be able to distinguish between cell types, but this powerful technique has not yet been deployed on the macroscale for the primary surveillance of contamination in healthcare facilities to prevent HAI. Here we report experimental data for the specification and design of such a fluorescence-based detection instrument. We have characterized the complete fluorescence response of eleven clinically-relevant bacteria by generating excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) over broad wavelength ranges. Furthermore, a number of surfaces and items of equipment commonly present on a ward, and potentially responsible for pathogen transfer, have been analyzed for potential issues of background fluorescence masking the signal from contaminant bacteria. These include bedside handrails, nurse call button, blood pressure cuff and ward computer keyboard, as well as disinfectant cleaning products and microfiber cloth. All examined bacterial strains exhibited a distinctive double-peak fluorescence feature associated with tryptophan with no other cellular fluorophore detected. Thus, this fluorescence survey found that an emission peak of 340nm, from an excitation source at 280nm, was the cellular fluorescence signal to target for detection of bacterial contamination. The majority of materials analysed offer a spectral window through which bacterial contamination could indeed be detected. A few instances were found of potential problems of background fluorescence masking that of bacteria, but in the case of the microfiber cleaning cloth, imaging techniques could morphologically distinguish between stray strands and bacterial contamination.},

Thus, the purpose of our research was to devise a new method for funduscopic photography and fluorescein angiography in the normal or diseased retina of the small laboratory animal that would produce results comparable in optical quality and field coverage to those obtained in human clinical practice. To enhance the view of the small eye, a 2.2 Volk Panretinal lens was held in apposition to the lens of a clinical fundus camera, the Topcon TRC 50FT, by means of a custom made metal sleeve. Albino mice, albino rats, and pigmented rats were photographed. Fluorescein angiography was performed on pigmented rats. Fluorescein was administered intravenously via the jugular vein at a dose of 5 mg/kg. Various speeds of film and flash settings were used depending on the light source and the pigmentation of the animal. Attachment of the 2.2 Panretinal lens to the clinical fundus camera allowed for more clearly defined fundus photographs of the small laboratory animal, as well as an enlarged field of observation over conventional techniques. Consequently, angiography fields and stages documented in the small laboratory animal approximated those obtained in human clinical practice. This technique facilitates the visualization of small fundi and it allows for a fuller documentation of experimental retinal models.},

@article{Klonoff2012,
abstract = {Fluorescence represents a promising alternative technology to electrochemistry and spectroscopy for accurate analysis of glucose in diabetes; however, no implanted fluorescence glucose assay is currently commercially available. The method depends on the principle of fluorescence, which is the emission of light by a substance after absorbing light. A fluorophore is a molecule that will absorb energy of a specific wavelength and reemit energy at a different wavelength. A fluorescence glucose-sensing molecule can be constructed to increase or decrease in fluorescence from baseline according to the ambient concentration of glucose. A quantum dot is a semiconductor crystal that can serve as a sensor by fluorescing at a desired wavelength or color, depending on the crystal size and materials used. If receptor molecules for glucose can be adsorbed to single-wall carbon nanotubules, then the resulting binding of glucose to these receptors will alter the nanotubes' fluorescence. Fluorescence glucose sensors can provide a continuous glucose reading by being embedded into removable wire-shaped subcutaneous or intravenous catheters as well as other types of implanted structures, such as capsules, microcapsules, microbeads, nano-optodes, or capillary tubes. Fluorescence glucose-sensing methods, which are under development, offer four potential advantages over commercially used continuous glucose monitoring technologies: (1) greater sensitivity to low concentrations of glucose, (2) the possibility of constructing sensors that operate most accurately in the hypoglycemic range by using binding proteins with disassociation constants in this range, (3) less need to recalibrate in response to local tissue reactions around the sensor, and (4) no need to implant either a transmitter or a power source for wireless communication of glucose data. Fluorescence glucose sensors also have four significant disadvantages compared with commercially used continuous glucose monitoring technologies: (1) a damaging foreign body response; (2) a sensitivity to local pH and/or oxygen, which can affect the dye response; (3) potential toxicity of implanted dyes, especially if the implanted fluorophore cannot be fully removed; and (4) the necessity of always carrying a dedicated light source to interrogate the implanted sensor. Fluorescence sensing is a promising method for measuring glucose continuously, especially in the hypoglycemic range. If currently vexing technical and engineering and biocompatibility problems can be overcome, then this approach could lead to a new family of continuous glucose monitors.},

abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to determine whether the invisible near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence properties of methylene blue (MB), a dye already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for other indications, could be exploited for real-time, intra-operative identification of the ureters. Methods: The optical properties of MB were quantified in vitro. Open surgery and laparoscopic NIR fluorescence imaging systems were employed. Yorkshire pigs were injected intravenously with 0.1-mg/kg MB (n = 8), 10-mg furosemide followed by 0.1-mg/kg MB (n = 6), or 0.5-mg/kg MB (n = 6). The contrast-to-background ratio (CBR) of the kidney and ureters, and the MB concentration in the urine, were quantified. Results: Peak MB absorbance, emission, and intensity in urine occurred at 668 nm, 688 nm, and 20 ??mol/L, respectively. After intravenous injection, doses as low as 0.1-mg/kg MB provided prolonged imaging of the ureters, and a dose of 0.5 mg/kg provided statistically significant improvement of CBR. The preinjection of furosemide increased urine volume but did not improve CBR. Laparoscopic identification of the ureter using MB NIR fluorescence was demonstrated. Conclusion: Ureteral imaging using MB NIR fluorescence provides sensitive, real-time, intra-operative identification of the ureters during open and laparoscopic surgeries. ?? 2010 Mosby, Inc.

abstract = {Although the modern surgical era is highlighted by multiple technological advances and innovations, one area that has remained constant is the dependence of the surgeon's vision on white-light reflectance. This renders different body tissues in a limited palette of various shades of pink and red, thereby limiting the visual contrast available to the operating surgeon. Healthy tissue, anatomic variations, and diseased states are seen as slight discolorations relative to each other and differences are inherently limited in dynamic range. In the upcoming years, surgery will undergo a paradigm shift with the use of targeted fluorescence imaging probes aimed at augmenting the surgical armamentarium by expanding the "visible" spectrum available to surgeons. Such fluorescent "smart probes" will provide real-time, intraoperative, pseudo-color, high-contrast delineation of both normal and pathologic tissues. Fluorescent surgical molecular guidance promises another major leap forward to improve patient safety and clinical outcomes, and to reduce overall healthcare costs. This review provides an overview of current and future surgical applications of fluorescence imaging in diseased and nondiseased tissues and focus on the innovative fields of image processing and instrumentation.},

abstract = {Management of metastatic disease is integral to cancer treatment. Evaluation of metastases often requires surgical removal of all anatomically susceptible lymph nodes for ex vivo pathologic examination. We report a family of novel ratiometric activatable cell-penetrating peptides, which contain Cy5 as far red fluorescent donor and Cy7 as near-infrared fluorescent acceptor. Cy5 is quenched in favor of Cy7 re-emission until the intervening linker is cut by tumor-associated matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 (MMP2,9) or elastases. Such cleavage increases the Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio 40-fold and triggers tissue retention of the Cy5-containing fragment. This ratiometric increase provides an accelerated and quantifiable metric to identify primary tumors and metastases to liver and lymph nodes with increased sensitivity and specificity. This technique represents a significant advance over existing nonratiometric protease sensors and sentinel lymph node detection methods, which give no information about cancer invasion.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a non-invasive method for quantification of blood and pigment distributions across the posterior pole of the fundus from multispectral images using a computer-generated reflectance model of the fundus. METHODS: A computer model was developed to simulate light interaction with the fundus at different wavelengths. The distribution of macular pigment (MP) and retinal haemoglobins in the fundus was obtained by comparing the model predictions with multispectral image data at each pixel. Fundus images were acquired from 16 healthy subjects from various ethnic backgrounds and parametric maps showing the distribution of MP and of retinal haemoglobins throughout the posterior pole were computed. RESULTS: The relative distributions of MP and retinal haemoglobins in the subjects were successfully derived from multispectral images acquired at wavelengths 507, 525, 552, 585, 596, and 611 nm, providing certain conditions were met and eye movement between exposures was minimal. Recovery of other fundus pigments was not feasible and further development of the imaging technique and refinement of the software are necessary to understand the full potential of multispectral retinal image analysis. CONCLUSION: The distributions of MP and retinal haemoglobins obtained in this preliminary investigation are in good agreement with published data on normal subjects. The ongoing development of the imaging system should allow for absolute parameter values to be computed. A further study will investigate subjects with known pathologies to determine the effectiveness of the method as a screening and diagnostic tool.},

abstract = {The autofluorescence under ultraviolet excitation arising from normal squamous and columnar esophageal mucosa is investigated using multispectral microscopy. The results suggest that the autofluorescence signal arises from the superficial tissue layer due to the short penetration depth of the ultraviolet excitation. As a result, visualization of esophageal epithelial cells and their organization can be attained using wide-field autofluorescence microscopy. Our results show tryptophan to be the dominant source of emission under 266 nm excitation, while emission from NADH and collagen are dominant under 355 nm excitation. The analysis of multispectral microscopy images reveals that tryptophan offers the highest image contrast due to its non-uniform distribution in the sub-cellular matrix. This technique can simultaneously provide functional and structural imaging of the microstructure using only the intrinsic tissue fluorophores.},

@article{Blodgett2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes may alter renal glucose reabsorption by sodium (Na(+))-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs). Radiolabeled substrates are commonly used for in vitro measurements of SGLT activity in kidney cells. We optimized a method to measure glucose uptake using a fluorescent substrate, 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (2-NBDG).

METHODS: Uptake buffers for 2-NBDG were the same as for (14)C-labeled $\alpha$-methyl-d-glucopyranoside ([(14)C]AMG). Cell lysis buffer was optimized for fluorescence of 2-NBDG and Hoechst DNA stain. Uptake was performed on cultures of primary mouse kidney cells (PMKCs), the LLC-PK(1) proximal tubule cell line, or COS-7 cells transiently overexpressing mouse SGLT1 or SGLT2 by incubating cells at 37°C in buffer containing 50-200 $\mu$M 2-NBDG. Microscopy was performed to visualize uptake in intact cells, while a fluorescence microplate reader was used to measure intracellular concentration of 2-NBDG ([2-NBDG](i)) in cell homogenates.

RESULTS: Fluorescent cells were observed in cultures of PMKCs and LLC-PK(1) cells exposed to 2-NBDG in the presence or absence of Na(+). In LLC-PK(1) cells, 2-NBDG transport in the presence of Na(+) had a maximum rate of 0.05 nmol/min/$\mu$g of DNA. In these cells, Na(+)-independent uptake of 2-NBDG was blocked with the GLUT inhibitor, cytochalasin B. The Na(+)-dependent uptake of 2-NBDG decreased in response to co-exposure to the SGLT substrate, AMG, and it could be blocked with the SGLT inhibitor, phlorizin. Immunocytochemistry showed overexpression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 in COS-7 cells, in which, in the presence of Na(+), [2-NBDG](i) was fivefold higher than in controls.

CONCLUSION: Glucose transport in cultured kidney cells can be measured with the fluorescence method described in this study.},

abstract = {We present an imaging system based on light emitting diode (LED) illumination that produces multispectral optical images of the human ocular fundus. It uses a conventional fundus camera equipped with a high power LED light source and a highly sensitive electron-multiplying charge coupled device camera. It is able to take pictures at a series of wavelengths in rapid succession at short exposure times, thereby eliminating the image shift introduced by natural eye movements (saccades). In contrast with snapshot systems the images retain full spatial resolution. The system is not suitable for applications where the full spectral resolution is required as it uses discrete wavebands for illumination. This is not a problem in retinal imaging where the use of selected wavelengths is common. The modular nature of the light source allows new wavelengths to be introduced easily and at low cost. The use of wavelength-specific LEDs as a source is preferable to white light illumination and subsequent filtering of the remitted light as it minimizes the total light exposure of the subject. The system is controlled via a graphical user interface that enables flexible control of intensity, duration, and sequencing of sources in synchrony with the camera. Our initial experiments indicate that the system can acquire multispectral image sequences of the human retina at exposure times of 0.05 s in the range of 500-620 nm with mean signal to noise ratio of 17 dB (min 11, std 4.5), making it suitable for quantitative analysis with application to the diagnosis and screening of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.},

abstract = {Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), a widely used animal model of human posterior/pan-uveitis, is extremely valuable in allowing understanding of the pathogenesis of uveitis as well as in developing new treatments. Depending on the animal strain and immunization protocol used, the clinical course of EAU can be acute, severe and involving the anterior and posterior part of the eye, or chronic, mild and involving only the posterior part of the eye. Clinical signs of EAU can be examined by bio-microscopy. Using appropriate criteria EAU can be quantitatively evaluated clinically in living animals. However, correlation of research within different laboratories is difficult since clinical grading systems are subjective and susceptible to considerable variability. In this study, we have developed a recordable, image-based clinical grading system for the chronic models of EAU. Fundus images were taken from EAU mice using an endoscopic imaging system. Fundus changes were classified as (1) inflammatory changes (including optic disc inflammation, vasculitis and retinal tissue inflammation) and (2) retinal structural damage. Each element was scored separately based on the severity of the lesions, and the average score of the three inflammatory elements was used as the overall EAU clinical inflammation grade of the eye. The validity and reproducibility of the grading system was tested using a set of images scored independently in a masked manner by 5 individuals. The grading system proved robust, easy to use and reliable. We offer this image-based EAU clinical grading system as a useful quantitative evaluation method for clinical grading of the severity of inflammation in the chronic EAU model, in which the inflammation can be mild and mainly involves posterior part of the eye. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is an urgent need to develop technology for continuous in vivo glucose monitoring in subjects with diabetes mellitus. Problems with existing devices based on electrochemistry have encouraged alternative approaches to glucose sensing in recent years, and those based on fluorescence intensity and lifetime have special advantages, including sensitivity and the potential for non-invasive measurement when near-infrared light is used. Several receptors have been employed to detect glucose in fluorescence sensors, and these include the lectin concanavalin A (Con A), enzymes such as glucose oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase and hexokinase/glucokinase, bacterial glucose-binding protein, and boronic acid derivatives (which bind the diols of sugars). Techniques include measuring changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a fluorescent donor and an acceptor either within a protein which undergoes glucose-induced changes in conformation or because of competitive displacement; measurement of glucose-induced changes in intrinsic fluorescence of enzymes (e.g. due to tryptophan residues in hexokinase) or extrinsic fluorophores (e.g. using environmentally sensitive fluorophores to signal protein conformation). Non-invasive glucose monitoring can be accomplished by measurement of cell autofluorescence due to NAD(P)H, and fluorescent markers of mitochondrial metabolism can signal changes in extracellular glucose concentration. Here we review the principles of operation, context and current status of the various approaches to fluorescence-based glucose sensing.},

Using this dual-reporter imaging methodology, tumor contrast-to-noise ratio was amplified by >6 times at 1 h postinjection and >2 times at 24 h. Furthermore, by as early as 20 min postinjection, the dual-reporter imaging signal in the tumor correlated significantly with a validated marker of receptor density (P<0.05, r=0.93). Dual-reporter imaging can improve sensitivity and specificity over conventional fluorescence imaging in applications such as fluorescence-guided surgery and directly approximates the receptor status of the tumor, a measure that could be used to inform choices of biological therapies.},

abstract = {An algorithm is proposed for the spectral and colorimetric characterization of digital still cameras (DSC) which allows them to be used as tele-colorimeters with CIE-XYZ color output, in cd/m(2). The spectral characterization consists in the calculation of the color-matching functions from the previously measured spectral sensitivities. The colorimetric characterization consists in transforming the raw RGB digital data into absolute tristimulus values CIE-XYZ (in cd/m(2)) under variable and unknown spectroradiometric conditions. Thus, in the first stage, a gray balance was applied over the raw RGB digital data to convert them into RGB relative colorimetric values. In the second stage, an algorithm of luminance adaptation versus lens aperture was inserted in the basic colorimetric profile. Capturing the ColorChecker chart under different light sources, and comparing the estimated XYZ data according to the developed color model in relation to the measured XYZ data (in cd/m(2)) using a telespectroradiometer, we verified that the proposed characterization model may be broken down into two portions. Firstly, there is the basic colorimetric profile in combination with the new luminance adaptation algorithm. Secondly, there is the linear correction term due only to the mismatch of the color matching functions of the camera. Although the linear color correction term works relatively well, despite the imposed initial conditions (unknown spectral content of the scene), the separation of the proposed characterization model into two portions (raw and corrected performance) would allow the future comparison of various commercial cameras.},

abstract = {We introduce a noncontact imaging method utilizing multifrequency structured illumination for improving lateral and axial resolution and contrast of fluorescent molecular probes in thick, multiple-scattering tissue phantoms. The method can be implemented rapidly using a spatial light modulator and a simple image demodulation scheme similar to structured light microscopy in the diffraction regime. However, imaging is performed in the multiple-scattering regime utilizing spatially modulated scalar photon density waves. We demonstrate that by increasing the structured light spatial frequency, fluorescence from deeper structures is suppressed and signals from more superficial objects enhanced. By measuring the spatial frequency dependence of fluorescence, background can be reduced by localizing the signal to a buried fluorescent object. Overall, signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and resolution improvements are dependent on spatial frequency and object depth/dimension with as much as sevenfold improvement in SBR and 33\% improvement in resolution for approximately 1-mm objects buried 3 mm below the surface in tissue-like media with fluorescent background.},

abstract = {Purpose: Near infrared fluorescence imaging is a promising technique that offers real-time visual information during surgery. In this study we report the first clinical results to our knowledge of ureteral imaging using near infrared fluorescence after a simple peripheral infusion of methylene blue. Furthermore, we assessed the optimal timing and dose of methylene blue. Materials and Methods: A total of 12 patients who underwent lower abdominal surgery were included in this prospective feasibility study. Near infrared fluorescence imaging was performed using the Mini-FLARE??? imaging system. To determine optimal timing and dose, methylene blue was injected intravenously at doses of 0.25, 0.5 or 1 mg/kg after exposure of the ureters. Imaging was performed for up to 60 minutes after injection. Results: In all patients both ureters could be clearly visualized within 10 minutes after infusion of methylene blue. The signal lasted at least up to 60 minutes after injection. The mean signal-to-background ratio of the ureter was 2.27 ?? 1.22 (4), 2.61 ?? 1.88 (4) and 3.58 ?? 3.36 (4) for the 0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg groups, respectively. A mixed model analysis was used to compare signal-to-background ratios among dose groups and times, and to assess the relationship between dose and time. A significant difference among time points (p <0.001) was found. However, no difference was observed among dose groups (p = 0.811). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the first successful use of near infrared fluorescence using low dose methylene blue for the identification of the ureters during lower abdominal surgery. ?? 2013 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: EAU is an established preclinical model for assessment of immunotherapeutic efficacy toward translation of therapy for posterior uveitis. Reliable screening of clinical features that correlate with underlying retinal changes and damage has not been possible to date. This study was undertaken to describe, validate, and correlate topical endoscopic fundus imaging (TEFI) with histologic features of murine experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), with the intent of generating a rapid noninvasive panretinal assessment of ocular inflammation. METHODS: EAU was induced in B10.RIII mice by immunization with the peptide RBP-3(161-180). The clinical disease course (days 0-63) was monitored and documented using TEFI. Disease severity and pathology were confirmed at various time points by histologic assessment. The composition of the cell infiltrate was also examined and enumerated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: TEFI demonstrated the hallmark features of EAU, paralleling many of the clinical features of human uveitis, and closely aligned with underlying histologic changes, the severity of which correlated significantly with the number of infiltrating retinal leukocytes. Leukocytic infiltration occurred before manifestation of clinical disease and clinically fulminant disease, as well as cell infiltrate, resolved faster than histologic scores. During the resolution phase, neither the clinical appearance nor number of infiltrating retinal leukocytes returned to predisease levels. CONCLUSIONS: In EAU, there is a strong correlation between histologic severity and the number of infiltrating leukocytes into the retina. TEFI enhances the monitoring of clinical disease in a rapid and noninvasive fashion. Full assessment of preclinical immunotherapeutic efficacy requires the use of all three parameters: TEFI, histologic assessment, and flow cytometric analysis of retinal infiltrate.},

We refer to this as nonnegative independent component analysis and we consider methods for solving this task. For independent sources with nonzero probability density function (pdf) p(s) down to s=0 it is sufficient to find the orthonormal rotation y=Wz of prewhitened sources z=Vx, which minimizes the mean squared error of the reconstruction of z from the rectified version y/sup +/ of y. We suggest some algorithms which perform this, both based on a nonlinear principal component analysis (PCA) approach and on a geodesic search method driven by differential geometry considerations. We demonstrate the operation of these algorithms on an image separation problem, which shows in particular the fast convergence of the rotation and geodesic methods and apply the approach to a musical audio analysis task.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We assessed the ability of laser induced autofluorescence spectroscopy to distinguish neoplastic urothelial bladder lesions from normal or nonspecific inflammatory mucosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three different pulsed laser excitation wavelengths were used successively: 308 nm. (xenium chloride excimer laser), 337 nm. (nitrogen laser) and 480 nm. (coumarin dye laser). The excitation light was delivered by a specially devised multifiber catheter connected to a 1 mm. core diameter silica monofiber introduced through the working channel of a standard cystoscope with saline irrigation. The captured fluorescence light was focused onto an optical multichannel analyzer detection system. Device performance was evaluated in 25 patients after obtaining consent and immediately before transurethral resection of a bladder tumor. Spectroscopic results were compared with histological findings. RESULTS: At 337 and 480 nm. excitation wavelengths the overall fluorescence intensity of bladder tumors was clearly decreased compared to normal urothelial mucosa regardless of tumor stage and grade. At the 308 nm. excitation wavelength the shape of the tumor spectra, including carcinoma in situ, was markedly different from that of normal or nonspecific inflammatory mucosa. No absolute intensity determinations were required in this situation, since a definite diagnosis could be established based on the fluorescence intensity ratio at 360 and 440 nm. CONCLUSIONS: This spectroscopic study could be particularly useful to design a simplified autofluorescence imaging device for detection of occult urothelial neoplasms.},

abstract = {The digital camera is a powerful tool to capture images for use in image processing and colour communication. However, the RGB signals generated by a digital camera are device-dependent, i.e., different digital cameras produce different RGB responses for the same scene. Furthermore, they are not colorimetric, i.e., the output RGB signals do not directly correspond to the device-independent tristimulus values based on the CIE standard colorimetric observer. One approach for deriving a colorimetric mapping between camera RGB signals and CIE tristimulus values uses polynomial modeling and is described here. The least squares fitting technique was used to derive the coefficients of 3 × n polynomial transfer matrices, yielding a modeling accuracy typically averaging 1 $\Delta$E units in CMC(1:1) when a 3 × 11 matrix is used. Experiments were carried out to investigate the repeatability of the digitizing system, characterization performance when different polynomials were used, modeling accuracy when 8-bit and 12-bit RGB data were used for characterization, and the number of reference samples needed to achieve a reasonable degree of modeling accuracy. Choice of characterization target and media and their effect on metamerism have been examined. It is demonstrated that a model is dependent upon both media and colorant, and applying a model to other media/colorants can lead to serious eye–camera metamerism problems. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

abstract = {Purpose: To develop a multi-spectral method to measure oxygen saturation of the retina in the human eye. Methods: Five Cynomolgus monkeys with normal eyes were anesthetized with intramuscular ketamine/xylazine and intravenous pentobarbital. Multi-spectral fundus imaging was performed in five monkeys with a commercial fundus camera equipped with a liquid crystal tuned filter in the illumination light path and a 16-bit digital camera. Recording parameters were controlled with software written specifically for the application. Seven images at successively longer oxygen-sensing wavelengths were recorded within 4 seconds. Individual images for each wavelength were captured in less than 100 msec of flash illumination. Slightly misaligned images of separate wavelengths due to slight eye motion were registered and corrected by translational and rotational image registration prior to analysis. Numerical values of relative oxygen saturation of retinal arteries and veins and the underlying tissue in between the artery/vein pairs were evaluated by an algorithm previously described, but which is now corrected for blood volume from averaged pixels (n > 1000). Color saturation maps were constructed by applying the algorithm at each image pixel using a Matlab script. Results: Both the numerical values of relative oxygen saturation and the saturation maps correspond to the physiological condition, that is, in a normal retina, the artery is more saturated than the tissue and the tissue is more saturated than the vein. With the multi-spectral fundus camera and proper registration of the multi-wavelength images, we were able to determine oxygen saturation in the primate retinal structures on a tolerable time scale which is applicable to human subjects. Conclusions: Seven wavelength multi-spectral imagery can be used to measure oxygen saturation in retinal artery, vein, and tissue (microcirculation). This technique is safe and can be used to monitor oxygen uptake in humans. This work is original and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.},

Nerves are usually identified by their appearance and relationship to nearby structures or detected by local electrical stimulation (electromyography), but thin or buried nerves are sometimes overlooked. Here, we use phage display to select a peptide that binds preferentially to nerves. After systemic injection of a fluorescently labeled version of the peptide in mice, all peripheral nerves are clearly delineated within 2 h. Contrast between nerve and adjacent tissue is up to tenfold, and useful contrast lasts up to 8 h. No changes in behavior or activity are observed after treatment, indicating a lack of obvious toxicity. The fluorescent probe also labels nerves in human tissue samples. Fluorescence highlighting is independent of axonal integrity, suggesting that the probe could facilitate surgical repair of injured nerves and help prevent accidental transection.},

In order to prevent severe permanent damage to the eye and enable timely treatment, the fundus of the eye in such children has to be examined according to established procedures. For these examinations, our miniaturized fundus camera is intended to allow the acquisition of wide-angle digital pictures of the fundus for on-line or off-line diagnosis and documentation. We designed two prototypes of a miniaturized fundus camera, one with graded refractive index (GRIN)-based optics, the other with conventional optics. Two different modes of illumination were compared: transscleral and transpupillary. In both systems, the size and weight of the camera were minimized. The prototypes were tested on young rabbits. The experiments led to the conclusion that the combination of conventional optics with transpupillary illumination yields the best results in terms of overall image quality.},

abstract = {Multispectral optoacoustic (photoacoustic) tomography (MSOT) is a hybrid modality that can image through several millimeters to centimeters of diffuse tissues, attaining resolutions typical of ultrasound imaging. The method can further identify tissue biomarkers by decomposing the spectral contributions of different photo-absorbing molecules of interest. In this work we investigate the performance of blind source unmixing methods and spectral fitting approaches in decomposing the contributions of fluorescent dyes from the tissue background, based on MSOT measurements in mice. We find blind unmixing as a promising method for accurate MSOT decomposition, suitable also for spectral unmixing in fluorescence imaging. We further demonstrate its capacity with temporal unmixing on real-time MSOT data obtained in-vivo for enhancing the visualization of absorber agent flow in the mouse vascular system.},

abstract = {Detection of intrinsic or extrinsically administered chromophores and photo-absorbing nanoparticles has been achieved by Multi-Spectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT). The detection sensitivity of MSOT depends not only on the signal to noise ratio considerations, as in conventional optoacoustic (photoacoustic) tomography implementations, but also on the ability to resolve the molecular targets of interest from the absorbing tissue background by means of spectral un-mixing or sub-pixel detection methods. However, it is not known which un-mixing methods are optimally suited for the characteristics of multispectral optoacoustic images. In this work we investigated the performance of different sub-pixel detection methods, typically used in remote sensing hyperspectral imaging, within the context of MSOT. A quantitative comparison of the different algorithmic approaches was carried out in an effort to identify methods that operate optimally under the particulars of MSOT applications. We find that statistical sub-pixel detection methods can demonstrate a unique detection performance with up to five times enhanced sensitivity as compared to linear un-mixing approximations, under the condition that the optical agent of interest is sparsely present within the tissue volume, as common when using targeted agents and reporter genes.},

One common economic motivation is to save costs in the development of the software by spreading them over the participating parties. However, this is just the beginning. Beyond sharing costs, participating firms can increase their revenue through the provision and increased sale of complementary products. Also, by establishing a successful open source platform, software firms can compete more effectively across technology stacks and thereby increase their addressable market. Not to be neglected, community open source software is a common good, creating increased general welfare and hence goodwill for the involved companies.},

The Microarray Gene Expression Data society and the Proteomics Standards Initiative have committed to using FuGE as the basis for defining their respective standards, and other standards groups, including the Metabolomics Standards Initiative, are evaluating FuGE in their development efforts. Adoption of FuGE by multiple standards bodies will enable uniform reporting of common parts of functional genomics workflows, simplify data-integration efforts and ease the burden on researchers seeking to fulfill multiple minimum reporting requirements.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the quality of handover of patients in the resuscitation room by describing the current perceptions of medical and ambulance staff. METHODS: This was a descriptive survey using two anonymous questionnaires to gauge current opinion, one designed for medical staff and the other for ambulance staff. Questionnaires were distributed to medical staff in two teaching hospital accident and emergency (A\&E) departments and ambulance personnel in the Tayside region of Scotland. RESULTS: 30 medical and 67 ambulance staff completed questionnaires. Some 19.4\% of ambulance staff received formal training in giving a handover, 83\% of the remaining felt there was a need for training. Medical staff conveyed their belief that handovers were very variable between crews and that they did not feel radio reports were well structured. Ambulance crews felt that medical staff did not pay attention to their handovers. Ambulance staff seemed satisfied with the quality of their handovers, although medical staff were less positive particularly in the context of self poisoning and chest pain. Both seem to be least confident with regards to the handover of paediatric emergencies. Medical staff were generally less satisfied with the reporting of vital signs than the history provided. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a generally positive perception of handovers there may be some room for improvement, in particular in the area of medical emergencies. Ambulance staff training should produce a structure for the handover that is recognisable to medical staff. The aim being a smooth and efficient transfer from prehospital agencies to A\&E staff.},

abstract = {The history of systematized automation in clinical laboratories in Japan started in 1981. At that time, about 12 laboratory technicians worked in a typical private University hospital laboratory (average size 1000 beds), whereas in national university hospitals (typical size 600 beds), the number of technicians was as low as 18-25. In 1981, the Kochi Medical School was founded as a new national school, and laboratory staffing was limited by the Ministry of Education to only 19 technicians for the first 3 years. Therefore, we started to develop a fully automated laboratory system by ourselves rather than accepting an intolerable shortage of technicians. The system was based on conveyor and robotic technology, and we called this approach systematization. Ten years later, systematized automation was introduced into the Japanese market. As a result, 72\% of the national university hospitals in Japan installed commercial systems for systematization. There is a trend now in hospitals with sufficient numbers of technicians, to introduce fully automated systems in their laboratories as well, and even small hospitals with less than 100 beds are planning to introduce such systems. However, current technology is too expensive and not sufficiently standardized to meet the needs of these market segments in Japan. We recommend that companies agree on common shapes and sizes of racks and include more flexible robotic technology in their sample handling systems, to allow for plug and play systems and to make systematization affordable for every laboratory in the world.},

Um eine geeignete theoretische Basis zu schaffen, wird dar\"{u}ber hinaus ein detaillierter \"{U}berblick \"{u}ber die Entwicklung der Tabletoptechnologie in den letzten Jahren und den dabei zentralen Forschungs- und Problemfeldern im Kontext der Entwicklung von Benutzerschnittstellen f\"{u}r Tabletopsysteme gegeben. Zudem werden schlie\ss lich auch im Rahmen der Arbeit relevante Aspekte der Multi-Device-Interaktion skizziert. Diesem theoretisch ausgerichteten Teil der Arbeit folgt schlie\ss lich eine Beschreibung der Entwicklung des Anwendungskonzepts und der dabei formulierten Anforderungen und Designzielen, welche in Form eines ersten, papierbasierten Prototypen visualisiert werden. Aufbauend auf diesen konzeptuellen \"{U}berlegungen wird schlie\ss lich die konkrete technische Umsetzung der Anwendung Multi/Touch/Device MindMapper in Form eines High-Level-Prototypen auf Basis des MT4j-Frameworks (Tabletop) und des Android-Betriebssystems (Smartphone) beleuchtet. Eine Diskussion dieses finalen Prototypen und erster praktischer Erfahrungen sowie ein Ausblick auf Erweiterungsm\"{o}glichkeiten des Systems und \"{u}ber den Rahmen der Arbeit hinaus gehende Fragestellungen schlie\ss en die Arbeit ab. Schlussendlich kann gezeigt werden, dass die im Rahmen des Anwendungskonzept definierten Anforderungen mit Hilfe der verwendeten Frameworks bis auf wenige Ausnahmen erfolgreich umgesetzt werden konnten. Dar\"{u}ber hinaus kann der Anwendung durch die aus dem Testbetrieb gewonnenen Erkenntnisse eine grunds\"{a}tzliche Praktikabilit\"{a}t attestiert, ebenso konnten einige Ansatzpunkte f\"{u}r weitere Verbesserungen und Tests aufgedeckt werden.},

abstract = {The analysis of transcriptome, which was over the past decade based mostly on microarray technologies, is now being superseded by so-called next generation sequencing (NGS) systems that changed the way to explore entire transcriptome. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), one application of NGS, is a powerful tool, providing information not only about the expression level of genes but also further about the structure of transcripts as it enables to unequivocally identify splicing events, RNA editing products, and mutations in expressed coding sequences within a single experiment. Herein, we describe step by step the deoxy-UTP (dUTP) strand-marking protocol [Parkhomchuk, D., Borodina, T., Amstislavskiy, V., Banaru, M., Hallen, L., Krobitsch, S., Lehrach, H., Soldatov, A. (2009). Transcriptome analysis by strand-specific sequencing of complementary DNA. Nucleic Acids Res.37(18), e123], which has been recently reviewed as the leading protocol for strand-specific RNA-Seq library preparation [Levin, J. Z., Yassour, M., Adiconis, X., Nusbaum, C., Thompson, D. A., Friedman, N., Gnirke, A., Regev, A. (2009). Comprehensive comparative analysis of strand-specific RNA sequencing methods. Nat. Methods7(9), 709-715]. The procedure starts with the isolation of the polyA fraction (mRNA) within a pool of total RNA, followed by its fragmentation. Then double-stranded (ds) cDNA synthesis is performed with the incorporation of dUTP in the second strand. The ds cDNA fragments are further processed following a standard sequencing library preparation scheme tailored for the Illumina sequencing platform: end polishing, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and size selection. Prior to final amplification, the dUTP-marked strand is selectively degraded by Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase (UDG). The remaining strand is amplified to generate a cDNA library suitable for sequencing.},

abstract = {This second edition book focuses on planning and scheduling applications with a new chapter on planning and scheduling in health care. Planning and scheduling are forms of decision-making that play an important role in most manufacturing and services industries. The planning and scheduling functions in a company typically use analytical techniques and heuristic methods to allocate its limited resources to the activities that have to be done.The application areas considered in this book are divided into manufacturing applications and services applications. The book covers four areas in planning and scheduling: preliminary scheduling, planning and scheduling in manufacturing, planning and scheduling in services and systems development and implementation.It covers four areas in services: reservations and timetabling, tournament scheduling, planning and scheduling in transportation, planning and sheduling in healthcare and workforce scheduling. At the end of each chapter, a case study or a system implementation is described in detail. Numerous examples and exercises throughout the book illustrate the material presented. The fundamentals concerning the methodologies used in the application chapters are covered in the appendices. The book comes with a CD-ROM that contains various sets of PowerPoint slides. The CD also contains several planning and scheduling systems that have been developed in academia as well as generic optimization software that has been developed in industry. This book is suitable for more advanced students in industrial engineering and operations research as well as graduate students in business. Michael Pinedo is the Julius Schlesinger Professor of Operations Management in the Stern School of Business at New York University. His research interests lie in the theoretical and applied aspects of planning and scheduling. He has written numerous papers on the theory of deterministic and stochastic scheduling and has also consulted extensively in industry. He has been actively involved in the development of several large industrial planning and scheduling systems. "The book may be very useful as an application guideline for practicioners from the manufacturing and services sectors, while it has a special value for academic people. In fact, the clear organization of the book and the enclosed CD with slides of various teachers who have already adopted the book as a reference for their course, are quite important elements for considering the book as a teaching aid."-Marco Garetti, Production Planning and Control},

@techreport{NN2013,
abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) software from the various vendors has become very difficult to evaluate and compare . The market is now at the maturity level where most of the vendors appear on the surface to have the simila r functionality. Using RFPs to compare products is made difficult because a “full support” check mark does not reflect a feature’s ease of use or if it will be included in the product without an additional charge. Having both IT and the business with th eir differing needs and weighting factors work together to select a BPM tool adds to the complexity of the selection . As a result, companies are often left unsure that they have selected the best product for their needs. IBM and Oracle have taken simila r approaches to BPM. Both products originate from a BPM pure play heritage. IBM acquired Lombardi’s BPM product in 20 10. Oracle acquired BEA and it s AquaLogic BPM product in 2008. IBM Business Process Manager consists of a variety of development tools and runtime engines from both their Lombardi and existing IBM legacy products. Oracle BPM Suite is a more unified product with tools designed specifically for the disparate needs of business users and developers. Based on feedback from customers and i ndustry consultants familiar with both products, the following factors combine to make Oracle BPM Suite the superior choice: 1. Functionality – Oracle BPM includes comprehensive features customers need on BPM projects. Included are: web - based business user p rocess modeling, content management, case management, portal, fully functional business rules, Business Activity Monitoring (BAM), data model and its entire portfolio of pre - built Process Accelerators . 2. Product Integration – Oracle BPM’s development tool s and its runtime architecture is very tightly integrated. The functionality in one tool is not duplicated in another. Development time is saved because artifacts in the project are kept in synch and are not lost as the work transitions between the busin ess users and developers. Whatever is modeled is exactly what will be executed. While Oracle BPM developers use a single well integrated tool, IBM BPM developers use two loosely spliced development tools with overlapping features. 3. Ease of use – Oracle BP M is the easier of the two products to use in three essential areas. First, the processes are modeled by the business and enhanced with technical details by developers in an easy to understand common format that both understand. Second, both developers and business people each have tools specifically built for their different skills and needs. The technical implementation components needed by developers in the tool they use are masked in the business users’ tool. Third, the tooling required to integrate to back - end systems is much easier to use in ORACLE BPM. 4. Cost – IBM Business Process Manager and its Industry Packs are significantly more expensive than Oracle BPM and its Process Accelerators . In addition, Oracle BPM comes with features IBM Business Proce ss Manager either does not possess or only includes at an additional charge. IBM Business Process Manager ’s Integration Designer tool has a very steep learning curve and more professional services to integrate the disparate components are required . Becau se Oracle BPM projects perform better than IBM Business Process Manager projects , less hardware and software needs to be purchased. 5. Business User Empowerment – The b usiness play s a much more important role on Oracle BPM projects. The dependency on IT is reduced because actual b usiness users participate in the full lifecycle of Oracle BPM project s by creating their own processes, user int erfaces, business rules and even the information carried by the individual work item instances using a simple web - based tool.},

We present a novel approach to feature construction for object detection called Evolution-COnstructed Features (ECO features).

ECO features are automatically constructed by uniquely employing a standard genetic algorithm to discover multiple series of transforms that are highly discriminative. Using ECO features provides several advantages over other object detection algorithms including: no need for a human expert to build feature sets or tune their parameters, ability to generate specialized feature sets for different objects, no limitations to certain types of image sources, and ability to find both global and local feature types.

Many factors affect the performance of appointment systems including arrival and service time variability, patient and provider preferences, available information technology and the experience level of the scheduling staff. In addition, a critical bottleneck lies in the application of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IE/OR) techniques. The most common types of health care delivery systems are described in this article with particular attention on the factors that make appointment scheduling challenging. For each environment relevant decisions ranging from a set of rules that guide schedulers to real-time responses to deviations from plans are described. A road map of the state of the art in the design of appointment management systems is provided and future opportunities for novel applications of IE/OR models are identified.},

abstract = {Sleep deprivation reduces cognitive performance; however, its effects on prospective memory (remembering to perform intended actions) are unknown. One view suggests that effects of sleep deprivation are limited to tasks associated with prefrontal functioning. An alternative view suggests a global, unspecific effect on human cognition, which should affect a variety of cognitive tasks. We investigated the impact of sleep deprivation (25 hours of sleep deprivation vs. no sleep deprivation) on prospective-memory performance in more resource-demanding and less resource-demanding prospectivememory tasks. Performance was lower after sleep deprivation and with a more resource-demanding prospective-memory task, but these factors did not interact. These results support the view that sleep deprivation affects cognition more globally and demonstrate that sleep deprivation increases failures to carry out intended actions, which may have severe consequences in safety-critical situations.},

abstract = {The open-source model has a lot to offer the business world. It's a way to build open standards as actual software, rather than paper documents. It's a way that many companies and individuals can collaborate on a product that none of them could achieve alone. It's the rapid bug-fixes and the changes that the user asks for, done to the user's own schedule. The open-source model also means increased security; because code is in the public view it will be exposed to extreme scrutiny, with problems being found and fixed instead of being kept secret until the wrong person discovers them. And last but not least, it's a way that the little guys can get together and have a good chance at beating a monopoly. Of all these benefits, the most fundamental is increased reliability. And if that's too abstract for you, you should think about how closed sources made the Year 2000 problem worse and why they might have very well killed your business.},

A neural network methodology is discussed, which uses environmental and physiological information available from on-line sensors, to estimate concentration of species in the bioreactor. Two case studies are presented, both based on the ethanol production by Zymomonas mobilis.

abstract = {There is much talk today about a business process management (BPM) rEvolution. The revolutionary part is about a new category of software known as the business process management system (BPMS). The evolutionary part is about using the BPMS to exploit existing business and technology assets in a way that creates new value. Along with any revolution comes confusion. What exactly is BPM? Isn’t it just workflow technology, which has been in use for twenty years, plus Web services? Why don’t we describe what is going on today as the “new workflow rEvolution,” a subtle extension of workflow systems? To answer these questions, we explore the foundations of the workflow paradigm, and describe the paradigm shift in technology that is needed to overcome limitations of workflow systems to build and deploy robust Business Process Management Systems (BPMS)—the kind of information systems that businesses now demand as new sources of competitive advantage in an ever more uncertain and complex global economy. Along the way, we explain how languages such as BPML, inspired by the mathematics of Pi Calculus, can model all workflow patterns and the services provided by workflow engines [Ref 2]. The mathematical underpinnings allow the development of software products that include implementations of such languages to unify the lifecycle management of end-to-end business processes that include workflow semantics.},

Careful adherence to established brachytherapy standards has been shown to improve the likelihood of procedural success and reduce the incidence of treatment-related morbidity. A collaborative effort of the American College of Radiology (ACR) and American Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) has produced a practice guideline for permanent prostate brachytherapy. The guideline defines the qualifications and responsibilities of all the involved personnel, including the radiation oncologist, physicist and dosimetrist. Factors with respect to patient selection and appropriate use of supplemental treatment modalities such as external beam radiation and androgen suppression therapy are discussed. Logistics with respect to the brachytherapy implant procedure, the importance of dosimetric parameters, and attention to radiation safety procedures and documentation are presented. Adherence to these practice guidelines can be part of ensuring quality and safety in a successful prostate brachytherapy program.},

abstract = {Clarity is a suite of software designed to run automation equipment (robots) in scientific labs. With Clarity one or many users can simultaneously run protocols using any hardware setup (such as plate readers or liquid handlers). Clarity automates processes with these machines by running protocols, or list of instructions, specified by users. Such instructions might be a list of commands for each instrument (such as using a robot arm to move a plate to an instrument, and then taking a measurement of that plate with another robot). Clarity uses XML files to specify these protocols (and includes a GUI to create them). In contrast to closed source automation programs, Clarity is exceptionally flexible and stable. Protocol instructions can be dynamically altered using complex flow control, allowing for data generated in real time to determine what procedures happen next. Similarly, multiple users can run protocols simultaneously, adding them to and from the common pool of protocols. The program is designed to rapidly recover from and alert the user of virtually any error, and it isolates instruments so that recovering one does not require a complete restart of the entire system. Clarity is written completely in C\# and is compatible with the Mono .NET framework implementation so can run on any operating system. It is composed of essentially four parts: A set of classes that provide an interface between the Clarity software and hardware resources. A runtime engine that manages these resources and runs protocols using them. A set of graphical user interfaces that allow users to observe the runtime engine, add or alter protocols, create new XML protocols using a GUI and interface directly with the instruments. A set of tools involved in error reporting. This includes a client application that allows users to watch video feeds and a remote monitor that uses Skype to call users in the event of a failure.},

Over the past 2 decades, the potential role of simulation in surgery has been explored with encouraging results; this can now be linked to direct improvement in the quality of care provision. Computer-assisted surgical platforms, such as robotic surgery, offer us the versatility to embrace a host of technical and technological developments. Rapid development in nanomedicine will expand the limits of operative performance through improved navigation and surgical precision. Integration of the multiple functions of the future operating room will be essential in optimising resource management. The key to bringing about the necessary paradigm shift in the design and delivery of modern surgical care is to appreciate that we now function in an information age, where the integrity of processes is driven by apt data management.},

abstract = {Review From the reviews: .,."There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes. The material is well-suported with many end-of-chapter problems." D.L. McLeish for Short Book Reviews of the ISI, December 2006 "The reader sees not only how measure theory is used to develop probability theory, but also how probability theory is used in applications. a The discourse is delivered in a theorem proof format and thus is better suited for classroom a . The authors prose is generally well thought out a . will make an attractive choice for a two-semester course on measure and probability, or as a second course for students with a semester of measure or probability theory under their belt." (Peter C. Kiessler, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 102 (479), 2007) "The book is a well written self-contained textbook on measure and probability theory. It consists of 18 chapters. Every chapter contains many well chosen examples and ends with several problems related to the earlier developed theory (some with hints). a At the very end of the book there is an appendix collecting necessary facts from set theory, calculus and metric spaces. The authors suggest a few possibilities on how to use their book." (Kazimierz Musial, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1125 (2), 2008) "The title of the book consists of the names of its two basic parts. The booka (TM)s third part is comprised of some special topics from probability theory. a The authors suggest using the book intwo-semester graduate programs in statistics or a one-semester seminar on special topics. The material of the book is standard a is clear, comprehensive and a \~{}without being intimidatinga (TM)." (Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes. From the reviews: "...There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes. The material is well-suported with many end-of-chapter problems." D.L. McLeish for Short Book Reviews of the ISI, December 2006},

abstract = {In most real-world environments, scheduling is an ongoing reactive process where the presence of a variety of unexpected disruptions is usually inevitable, and continually forces reconsideration and revision of pre-established schedules. Many of the approaches developed to solve the problem of static scheduling are often impractical in real-world environments, and the near-optimal schedules with respect to the estimated data may become obsolete when they are released to the shop floor. This paper outlines the limitations of the static approaches to scheduling in the presence of real-time information and presents a number of issues that have come up in recent years on dynamic scheduling.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe paper defines the problem of dynamic scheduling and provides a review of the state-of-the-art of currently developing research on dynamic scheduling. The principles of several dynamic scheduling techniques, namely, heuristics, meta-heuristics, multi-agent systems, and other artificial intelligence techniques are described in detail, followed by a discussion and comparison of their potential.},

We have confirmed Adam's conclusions through manual experiments. To describe Adam's research, we have developed an ontology and logical language.

Most research to date deals with unaided prospective memory performance outside a healthcare context. We report results from a field study investigating PM performance of intensive care nurses. Concepts from distributed cognition help to identify how nurses use physical properties of their working environment to manage PM demands. Results show that (1) PM demands can be classified using a taxonomy from aviation and (2) nurses are supported by and use properties of the environment to manage PM demands. Focusing on distributed support for prospective memory lets us study prospective memory in rich work contexts. The results inform health information system and device design and professional education.},

abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk. 0201633612B07092001},

abstract = {Abstract With the increasing documentation requirements and communication capabilities of medical devices in the operating room, the integration and modular networking of these devices have become more and more important. Commercial integrated operating room systems are mainly proprietary developments using usually proprietary communication standards and interfaces, which reduce the possibility of integrating devices from different vendors. To overcome these limitations, there is a need for an open standardized architecture that is based on standard protocols and interfaces enabling the integration of devices from different vendors based on heterogeneous software and hardware components. Starting with an analysis of the requirements for device integration in the operating room and the techniques used for integrating devices in other industrial domains, a new concept for an integration architecture for the operating room based on the paradigm of a service-oriented architecture is developed. Standardized communication protocols and interface descriptions are used. As risk management is an important factor in the field of medical engineering, a risk analysis of the developed concept has been carried out and the first prototypes have been implemented.},

abstract = {The generation of complex movement patterns, in particular, in cases where one needs to smoothly and accurately join trajectories in a dynamic way, is an important problem in robotics. This paper presents a novel joining method that is based on the modification of the original dynamic movement primitive formulation. The new method can reproduce the target trajectory with high accuracy regarding both the position and the velocity profile and produces smooth and natural transitions in position space, as well as in velocity space. The properties of the method are demonstrated by its application to simulated handwriting generation, which are also shown on a robot, where an adaptive algorithm is used to learn trajectories from human demonstration. These results demonstrate that the new method is a feasible alternative for joining of movement sequences, which has a high potential for all robotics applications where trajectory joining is required.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in serological and radiological techniques, liver biopsy remains the most reliable way to diagnose diffuse hepatic disease and hepatic nodules. The indications for this invasive technique must be weighed against the small, but not negligible, risk of a complication.

METHODS: The indications for liver biopsy are summarized on the basis of a selective review of the literature, including the published recommendations and position statements of specialty societies in Germany and abroad. The conclusions are supplemented with an evaluation of the authors' own experience.

RESULTS: The success of liver biopsy depends not only on the selection of the puncture method and on due attention to the relative and absolute contraindications, but also on the experience of the person carrying out the procedure. For patients with hepatitis of various etiologies, liver biopsy is used not only to establish the cause of the disorder, but also to assess the degree of inflammatory activity (grading) and the extent of fibrosis (staging).

CONCLUSION: Liver biopsy enables the reliable diagnosis of hepatic lesions and is an important aid to treatment planning and prognostication.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) architecture of bone marrow (BM) supports the renewal, maintenance, proliferation and differentiation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Efforts have been made towards the reconstruction of an ex vivo HSC culture system, which could have several potential clinical applications, especially in expansion of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for use in bone marrow transplantation (BMT). In the present study, a numerical model has been developed to investigate the fluid flow, shear stress, and nutrient distribution within a purpose-built scaffold placed inside a rotating wall perfused bioreactor (RWPB). Furthermore, a multi-lineage cellular growth model of haematopoietic cells is incorporated to mimic the complexity of the BM. The simulation results demonstrate that: (1) the fluid dynamics inside the scaffold are qualitatively similar to those in the in vivo BM microenvironment, and (2) the inlet conditions (inoculum density), transport properties (scaffold) and reaction parameters (consumption rates) are sufficient to support the growth of haematopoietic cells required for BMT applications. Specifically, the multi-lineage cellular growth model demonstrates that the system would be able to produce the minimum number of colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) required for transplantation in an average patient. The numerical model presented here enables the optimisation of scaffold design parameters, fluid dynamics and mass transfer environment necessary for developing a suitable ex vivo haematopoietic system.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a framework for workflows whose correctness is given by a set of resource allocation constraints and develops techniques for scheduling such systems. A workflow consists of a collection of coordinated tasks designed to carry out a well-defined complex process, such as catalog ordering, trip planning, or a business process in an enterprise. Scheduling of workflows is a problem of finding a correct execution sequence for the workflow tasks, that is, execution that obeys the constraints that embody the business logic of the workflow. Research on workflow scheduling has largely concentrated on temporal constraints, which specify correct ordering of tasks. Another important class of constraints—those that arise from resource allocation—has received relatively little attention in workflow modeling. Because resources are typically not limitless and cannot be shared, scheduling of a workflow execution involves decisions as to which resources to use and when. },

abstract = {Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) methods provide real-time estimation of 3D models from the sole input of a hand-held camera, routinely in mobile robotics scenarios. Medical endoscopic sequences mimic a robotic scenario in which a hand-held camera (monocular endoscope) moves along an unknown trajectory while observing an unknown cavity. However, the feasibility and accuracy of SLAM methods have not been extensively validated with human in-vivo image sequences. In this work, we propose a monocular visual SLAM algorithm tailored to deal with medical image sequences in order to provide an up-to-scale 3D map of the observed cavity and the endoscope trajectory at frame rate. The algorithm is validated over synthetic data and human in-vivo sequences corresponding to fifteen laparoscopic hernioplasties where accurate ground-truth distances are available. It can be concluded that the proposed procedure is: 1) non invasive, because only a standard monocular endoscope and a surgical tool are used; 2) convenient, because only a handcontrolled exploratory motion is needed; 3) fast, because the algorithm provides the 3D map and the trajectory in real time; 4) accurate, because it has been validated with respect to groundtruth; and 5) robust to inter-patient variability, because it has performed successfully over the validation sequences.},

abstract = {Clarity is a suite of software designed to run automation equipment (robots) in scientific labs. With Clarity one or many users can simultaneously run protocols using any hardware setup (such as plate readers or liquid handlers). Clarity automates processes with these machines by running protocols, or list of instructions, specified by users. Such instructions might be a list of commands for each instrument (such as using a robot arm to move a plate to an instrument, and then taking a measurement of that plate with another robot). Clarity uses XML files to specify these protocols (and includes a GUI to create them). In contrast to closed source automation programs, Clarity is exceptionally flexible and stable. Protocol instructions can be dynamically altered using complex flow control, allowing for data generated in real time to determine what procedures happen next. Similarly, multiple users can run protocols simultaneously, adding them to and from the common pool of protocols. The program is designed to rapidly recover from and alert the user of virtually any error, and it isolates instruments so that recovering one does not require a complete restart of the entire system. Clarity is written completely in C\# and is compatible with the Mono .NET framework implementation so can run on any operating system. It is composed of essentially four parts: A set of classes that provide an interface between the Clarity software and hardware resources. A runtime engine that manages these resources and runs protocols using them. A set of graphical user interfaces that allow users to observe the runtime engine, add or alter protocols, create new XML protocols using a GUI and interface directly with the instruments. A set of tools involved in error reporting. This includes a client application that allows users to watch video feeds and a remote monitor that uses Skype to call users in the event of a failure.},

This relatively hew method is compared with a more traditional prediction technique to judge its performance for prediction. Illustrative simulation results of a continuous stirred tank fermentor are used for this comparison. It is shown that neural network models are accurate with a certain degree of noise immunity. They offer the distinctive ability over more traditional methods to learn very naturally complex relationships without requiring the knowledge of the model structure.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for object detection using a feature construction method called Evolution-COnstructed (ECO) features. Most other object recognition approaches rely on human experts to construct features. ECO features are automatically constructed by uniquely employing a standard genetic algorithm to discover series of transforms that are highly discriminative. Using ECO features provides several advantages over other object detection algorithms including: no need for a human expert to build feature sets or tune their parameters, ability to generate specialized feature sets for different objects, and no limitations to certain types of image sources. We show in our experiments that ECO features perform better or comparable with hand-crafted state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms. An analysis is given of ECO features which includes a visualization of ECO features and improvements made to the algorithm.},

Twenty-four nurses participated in a 40-minute scenario simulating the start of a morning shift. The scenario included eight PM tasks. The presence or absence of a visually conspicuous cue for each task was manipulated. The presence of a visual cue improved recall compared to no cue (64\% vs. 50\%, p = 0.03 one-tailed, $\eta$(p)(2) = 0.15). Nurses used deliberate reminders to manage their PM demands. PM in critical care might be supported by increasing the visibility of cues related to tasks. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: Nurses must remember to execute multiple future tasks to ensure patient safety. We investigated the effect of visual cues on nurses' ability to remember future tasks. Experimental manipulation of cues in a representative intensive care unit simulation indicated that visual cues increase the likelihood that future tasks are executed.},

abstract = {We present mathematical models and solution algorithms for a family of staff scheduling problems arising in real life applications. In these problems, the daily assignments to be performed are given and the durations (in days) of the working and rest periods for each employee in the planning horizon are specified in advance, whereas the sequence in which these working and rest periods occur, as well as the daily assignment for each working period, have to be determined. The main objective is the minimization of the number of employees needed to perform all daily assignments in the horizon. We decompose the problem into two steps: the definition of the sequence of working and rest periods (called pattern ) for each employee, and the definition of the daily assignment to be performed in each working period by each employee. The first step is formulated as a covering problem for which we present alternative ILP models and exact enumerative algorithms based on these models. Practical experience shows that the best approach is based on the model in which variables are associated with feasible patterns and generated either by dynamic programming or by solving another ILP. The second step is stated as a feasibility problem solved heuristically through a sequence of transportation problems. Although in general this procedure may not find a solution (even if one exists), we present sufficient conditions under which our approach is guaranteed to succeed. We also propose an iterative heuristic algorithm to handle the case in which no feasible solution is found in the second step. We present computational results on real life instances associated with an emergency call center. The proposed approach is able to determine the optimal solution of instances involving up to several hundred employees and a working period of up to 6 months.},

This affords touch-enhanced motion gestures, such as one-handed zooming by holding ones thumb on the screen while tilting a device. We also consider the reverse perspective, that of motion-enhanced touch, which uses motion sensors to probe what happens underneath the surface of touch. Touching the screen induces secondary accelerations and angular velocities in the sensors. For example, our prototype uses motion sensors to distinguish gently swiping a finger on the screen from drags with a hard onset to enable more expressive touch interactions.},

Unlike synthesis techniques (e.g., based on regions), process mining aims at the discovery of models (e.g., Petri nets) from incomplete information (i.e., only example behavior is given). The more mature process mining techniques perform well on structured processes. However, most of the existing techniques fail miserably when confronted with unstructured processes. This paper attempts to "bring structure to the unstructured" by using an integrated combination of abstraction and clustering techniques. The ultimate goal is to present process models that are understandable by analysts and that lead to improved system/process redesigns.},

abstract = {For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the "alphabet" used to describe those systems.},

Such contextual information significantly enhances touch interaction in a broad range of applications, from conventional touchscreens to unique contexts and materials. For example, in our explorations we add touch and gesture sensitivity to the human body and liquids. We demonstrate the rich capabilities of Touch\'{e} with five example setups from different application domains and conduct experi- mental studies that show gesture classification accuracies of 99\% are achievable with our technology.},

abstract = {This paper presents intelligent object distribution architecture to maximize the performance and intelligence of a distributed surgical robotics system and its preliminary implementation in an MR-guided surgical robot system in an open-configuration MRI scanner. The method enables networked integration of a robot control server and multiple clients with minimum engineering overhead but maximum flexibility and performance. The clients in this study include an intraoperative imager, high-performance image processing computer(s), and surgical navigation host. The first contribution of the paper is to propose the use of object distribution by common object request broker architecture (CORBA), in which a robot control object on the robot control server can be remotely but transparently invoked from the clients regardless of their hardware, operating systems, or programming language. Second, we propose a technique to achieve additional flexibility by reporting the robot configuration information, i.e. geometry and kinematics of the robot, to the clients upon connection. Third, we ensure protection against an unauthorized entity by introducing a security control host that authorized the clients’ access to the robot server. In a prototype implementation of an MR-guided surgical robot system, the robot was controlled by surgical navigation software (the 3D Slicer) on a UNIX client by invoking the distributed control object on a robot control server on a PC. The method was evaluated in performance studies; and the result indicated 3.6 milliseconds for retrieving positions of the robot stages and 25.5 milliseconds to send a frame-based motion command, which are satisfactory for surgical robot control. In conclusion, the proposed method shows the potential usefulness of flexibly integrating the legacy software to a surgical robot system with minimum engineering overhead, thereby achieving highly complex and intelligent tasks in robot-assisted surgery.},

abstract = {In the present study, a dynamic mathematical model for the growth of granulocyte progenitor cells in the hematopoietic process is developed based on the principles of diffusion and chemical reaction. This model simulates granulocyte progenitor cell growth and oxygen consumption in a three-dimensional (3-D) perfusion bioreactor. Material balances on cells are coupled to the nutrient balances in 3-D matrices to determine the effects of transport limitations on cell growth. The method of volume averaging is used to formulate the material balances for the cells and the nutrients in the porous matrix containing the cells. All model parameters are obtained from the literature. The maximum cell volume fraction reached when oxygen is depleted in the cell layer at 15 days and is nearly 0.63, corresponding to a cell density of 2.25 x 10(8) cells/mL. The substrate inhibition kinetics for cell growth lead to complex effects with respect to the roles of oxygen concentration and supply by convection and diffusion on cell growth. Variation in the height of the liquid layer above the cell matrix where nutrient supply is introduced affected the relative and absolute amounts of oxygen supply by hydrodynamic flow and by diffusion across a gas permeable FEP membrane. Mass transfer restrictions of the FEP membrane are considerable, and the supply of oxygen by convection is essential to achieve higher levels of cell growth. A maximum growth rate occurs at a specific flow rate. For flow rates higher than this optimal, the high oxygen concentration led to growth inhibition and for lower flow rates growth limitations occur due to insufficient oxygen supply. Because of the nonlinear effects of the autocatalytic substrate inhibition growth kinetics coupled to the convective transport, the rate of growth at this optimal flow rate is higher than that in a corresponding well-mixed reactor where oxygen concentration is set at the maximum indicated by the inhibitory kinetics.},

Microfluidic based bioreactors provide a promising method for the spatial and temporal control of cell growth and stimuli. A three-dimensional nutrient transport model, incorporating the monolayer cell growth model, has been developed to investigate the influence of gradients of oxygen and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the cell culture in the continuous-flow microchannel bioreactor. Our results demonstrate that applying inlet concentration gradients of oxygen and EGF can induce variations of cell density in the y-direction. It is further found that compared to the oxygen gradients the EGF concentration gradients are more efficient in regulating the cell growth.},

@techreport{Craggs2011,
abstract = {Page 2 Executive Summary Business Process Management (BPM) has become a key focus for many companies, whether aimed at streamlining and automating critical processes, reducing costs or improvin g process effectiveness. The ability of BPM to bridge the divide between business communiti es and the IT systems runn ing business operations makes systems more agile and responsive to changing business needs, improves operational visibility which enables better governance and contro l, and opens the way to broader and deeper levels of business transformation and innovation. Software vendors have not b een slow to react to this opportunity, and although there has been significant market consolidation over recent year s, with smaller, specialist BPM companies being snapped up by some of the major IT suppliers, there are still a number of BPM so lutions in the marketplace. Three suppliers with quite different approaches to BPM are Pegasystems, IBM an d TIBCO Software. Pegasystems is a ‘pure play’ BPM vendor, with its entire business based around its BPM so lution. IBM has been committed to BPM as a driver of business value since the technology emerged, but this commitment has been greatly reinforced through its positive experiences with thousands of BPM-based global services engagements; as a result, IBM has brought considerable strength to bear on what it sees as a major strategic initiative. TIBCO Software has built a new BPM solution on its Java-based ActiveMatrix applicat ion platform, replacing the acquired Staffware iProcess Suite, and is looking to BPM to improv e the alignment of the ActiveMatrix pl atform with business needs. But the difficulty for senior managers is th at BPM can seem quite a complex area, with vendor presentations quickly dropping down into long and confusing lists of detailed technology arguments and functional checklists. What many managers are looking for is suffic ient information on the different vend or approaches to be able to get a feel for at least a priority list of potential suppliers. This assessment tries to satisfy this need, taking a high level look at the BPM functionality offered by each of these players and drawing out some of the main differences. In the final analysis, a key difference of philosophy and approach emerges throughout the assessment which is likely to strongly influence any BPM purchase decision. Pegasystems has taken the route of focusing on those decision-heavy processes often found in industries like financial services and insurance, and specializes in delivering packaged process solutions for specific process needs. IBM has opted to follow the dual path of providing packaged, industry-focused process templates to speed projec t delivery while at the same time enabling additional value to be de livered across a wider range of ente rprise needs. TIBCO Software has focused primarily on BPM as a logical extension to its SO A-based middleware offerings that improves its appeal to the business community. ...},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Electronic patient records are becoming more common in critical care. As their design and implementation are optimized for single users rather than for groups, we aimed to understand the differences in interaction between members of a multidisciplinary team during ward rounds using an electronic, as opposed to paper, patient medical record. METHODS: A qualitative study of morning ward rounds of an intensive care unit that triangulates data from video-based interaction analysis, observation, and interviews. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrates several difficulties the ward round team faced when interacting with each other using the electronic record compared with the paper one. The physical setup of the technology may impede the consultant's ability to lead the ward round and may prevent other clinical staff from contributing to discussions. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss technical and social solutions for minimizing the impact of introducing an electronic patient record, emphasizing the need to balance both. We note that awareness of the effects of technology can enable ward-round teams to adapt their formations and information sources to facilitate multidisciplinary communication during the ward round.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Association rule analysis methods are important techniques applied to gene expression data for finding expression relationships between genes. However, previous methods implicitly assume that all genes have similar importance, or they ignore the individual importance of each gene. The relation intensity between any two items has never been taken into consideration. Therefore, we proposed a technique named REMMAR (RElational-based Multiple Minimum supports Association Rules) algorithm to tackle this problem. This method adjusts the minimum relation support (MRS) for each gene pair depending on the regulatory relation intensity to discover more important association rules with stronger biological meaning. RESULTS: In the actual case study of this research, REMMAR utilized the shortest distance between any two genes in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene regulatory network (GRN) as the relation intensity to discover the association rules from two S.cerevisiae gene expression datasets. Under experimental evaluation, REMMAR can generate more rules with stronger relation intensity, and filter out rules without biological meaning in the protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). Furthermore, the proposed method has a higher precision (100\%) than the precision of reference Apriori method (87.5\%) for the discovered rules use a literature survey. Therefore, the proposed REMMAR algorithm can discover stronger association rules in biological relationships dissimilated by traditional methods to assist biologists in complicated genetic exploration.},

It's a way that many companies and individuals can collaborate on a product that none of them could achieve alone. It's the rapid bug-fixes and the changes that the user asks for, done to the user's own schedule. The open-source model also means increased security; because code is in the public view it will be exposed to extreme scrutiny, with problems being found and fixed instead of being kept secret until the wrong person discovers them. And last but not least, it's a way that the little guys can get together and have a good chance at beating a monopoly. Of all these benefits, the most fundamental is increased reliability. And if that's too abstract for you, you should think about how closed sources made the Year 2000 problem worse and why they might have very well killed your business.},

abstract = {The preparation of a reconstructed human epidermis is described with examples of its utilization in in vitro studies. The model was obtained by culturing normal human keratinocytes at high cell density for 14 days in serum-free and high calcium (1.5 m M) medium on an inert polycarbonate filter at the air-liquid interface. These stratified cultures showed histological features similar to those observed in vivo in the epidermis: a proliferating basal layer and differentiating spinous, granular, and cornified layers. Electron microscopy illustrated lamellar bodies, junctions and keratohyalin granules. Immunofluorescent localization of epidermal markers (keratins 14 and 10, involucrin and filaggrin) revealed typical differentiation. This in vitro reconstructed tissue was used in studies of toxic effects of chemicals. The modelled tissue showed progressive cytotoxicity of a skin irritant (benzalkonium chloride) and a sensitizer (dinitrochlorobenzene) as assessed by MTT assay. Moreover, differential release of interleukin-1alpha and interleukin-8 were measured after 20 h of incubation allowing the irritant to be distinguished from the sensitizer. Permeation studies indicated efficient barrier function of the reconstructed epidermis, as well as metabolizing properties towards hormones. This model can be custom-made and is potentially useful for studies involving keratinocytes in the epidermis, in basic science, dermatology or toxicology.},

Statt dieser sehr verk\"{u}rzten Sichtweise soll gefragt werden:- welche Versorgungsnotwendigkeiten ergeben sich im Krankenhaus, - welche Ziele sollten mit der Pflege im Krankenhaus erreicht werden und - welche Aufgaben ergeben sich daraus f\"{u}r die Pflege? Die Ausf\"{u}hrungen werden hier auf die station\"{a}re Versorgung reduziert, wenngleich die Barrieren zwischen ambulant und station\"{a}r im Krankenhaus zunehmend gesenkt werden und sich daraus ebenfalls Ver\"{a}nderungsnotwendigkeiten in der Krankenhausstruktur und -versorgung ergeben. },

abstract = {"Since its original introduction in 1997, the Unified Modeling Language has revolutionized software development. Every integrated software development environment in the world--open-source, standards-based, and proprietary--now supports UML and, more importantly, the model-driven approach to software development. This makes learning the newest UML standard, UML 2.0, critical for all software developers--and there isn't a better choice than this clear, step-by-step guide to learning the language." --Richard Mark Soley, Chairman and CEO, OMG If you're like most software developers, you're building systems that are increasingly complex. Whether you're creating a desktop application or an enterprise system, complexity is the big hairy monster you must manage. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) helps you manage this complexity. Whether you're looking to use UML as a blueprint language, a sketch tool, or as a programming language, this book will give you the need-to-know information on how to apply UML to your project. While there are plenty of books available that describe UML, Learning UML 2.0 will show you how to use it. Topics covered include: Capturing your system's requirements in your model to help you ensure that your designs meet your users' needs  Modeling the parts of your system and their relationships  Modeling how the parts of your system work together to meet your system's requirements  Modeling how your system moves into the real world, capturing how your system will be deployed Engaging and accessible, this book shows you how to use UML to craft and communicate your project's design. Russ Miles and Kim Hamilton have written a pragmatic introduction to UML based on hard-earned practice, not theory. Regardless of the software process or methodology you use, this book is the one source you need to get up and running with UML 2.0. Russ Miles is a software engineer for General Dynamics UK, where he works with Java and Distributed Systems, although his passion at the moment is Aspect Orientation and, in particular, AspectJ. Kim Hamilton is a senior software engineer at Northrop Grumman, where she's designed and implemented a variety of systems including web applications and distributed systems, with frequent detours into algorithms development.},

Our goal is to create a simple, open-source software infrastructure which is effective, easy to implement and easy to understand. SBW uses a broker-based architecture and enables applications (potentially running on separate, distributed computers) to communicate via a simple network protocol. The interfaces to the system are encapsulated in client-side libraries that we provide for different programming languages. We describe the SBW architecture and the current set of modules, as well as alternative implementation technologies.},

abstract = {Workflows are widely used in applications that require coordinated use of computational resources. Workflow definition languages typically abstract over some aspects of the way in which a workflow is to be executed, such as the level of parallelism to be used or the physical resources to be deployed. As a result, a workflow management system has responsibility for establishing how best to execute a workflow given the available resources. The Pegasus workflow management system compiles abstract workflows into concrete execution plans, and has been widely used in large-scale e-Science applications. This paper describes an extension to Pegasus whereby resource allocation decisions are revised during workflow evaluation, in the light of feedback on the performance of jobs at runtime. The contributions of this paper include: (i) a description of how adaptive processing has been retrofitted to an existing workflow management system; (ii) a scheduling algorithm that allocates resources based on runtime performance; and (Hi) an experimental evaluation of the resulting infrastructure using grid middleware over clusters.},

Its goal is to robustly generate the se- quence of atomic actions of seen longer actions in video in order to acquire knowledge for robots. The lower level of the system consists of two convolutional neural network (CNN) based recognition modules, one for classifying the hand grasp type and the other for object recognition. The higher level is a probabilistic manipulation action grammar based pars- ing module that aims at generating visual sentences for robot manipulation.

Hospitals play a major role for the examination and treatment of patients. The sequence how patients are assigned to hospital units determines the quality of treatment, the resource utilization, as well as the patients’ overall treatment time. Thus, efficient scheduling of patients in hospitals is crucial. Current approaches disregard the decentralised organization in hospitals and neglect the varying pathway of patients since they often focus on one single unit solely. We propose an agent-based coordination mechanism that overcomes these limitations. Patients and hospital resources are modeled as autonomous software agents which follow their own objectives. This reflects the decentralized structure in hospitals. Agents are coordinated by a distributed mechanism where software agents improve their situation through negotiations which moves towards an overall Pareto optimum. We show promising evaluations based on experiments.},

Therefore, it is difficult to solve problems in a process, by only using techniques that depend on the knowledge and know-how of engineers. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) techniques are supposed to assist engineers in extracting the non-trivial characteristics of a production process that are beyond their knowledge and know-how. However, the KDD process is basically a user-driven task and such a user-driven manner is not efficient enough for use in a manufacturing application. We developed an automated data-mining system designed for quality control in manufacturing. It has three features; periodical-analysis, storing the result and extracting temporal-variances of the result. We applied it to liquid crystal display fabrication and found that the data-mining system is useful for the rapid recovery from problems of the production process.},

In addition, many independent software vendors (ISVs), value-added resellers (VARs), and hardware vendors (OEMs or ODMs) use open-source frameworks, modules, and libraries inside their proprietary, for-profit products and services. From the customer's perspective, the ability to use open-source technology under standard commercial terms and support is valuable. Customers are willing to pay for the legal protection (e.g., indemnification from intellectual property infringement), "commercial-grade QA," and professional support/training/consulting that are typical of commercial software built on top of the innovation and independence that comes with open source.},

abstract = {Silverlight 5 is the latest iteration of Microsoft's cross-browser technology for creating rich user experiences on the Web. Like its predecessor, it rides atop the .NET Framework for maximum ease of use and coding efficiency. The new technology carries forward much of the work that has been done before and augments it in many important respects, including support for H.264 video, major improvements to the graphics engine (including true 3D rendering), and much richer data-binding options for interfacing with other applications. Pro Silverlight 5 in C\# is an invaluable reference for professional developers who want to discover the new features of Silverlight. Author Matthew MacDonald's expert advice guides you through creating rich media applications using Silverlight in the environment you're most productive in—no matter what the target platform. As you learn about the features that put Silverlight in direct competition with Adobe Flash, such as rich support for 2D and 3D drawing, animations, and media playback, you'll experience the plumbing of .NET and the design model of WPF through Silverlight—all of the same .NET technology that developers use to design next-generation Windows applications. Pro Silverlight 5 in C\# is a comprehensive tutorial, written from professional developer to professional developer. Please note: the print version of this title is black \& white; the eBook is full color. What you’ll learnTo develop rich media applications using Silverlight across browsers and platforms To create a project, set up a layout, and use controls To handle both 2D and 3D drawing, animation, and media playback through Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) To integrate web services support To use Silverlight in conjunction with ASP.NET and its interactions with HTML Who this book is for This book is for .NET developers encountering Silverlight for the first time. No prior knowledge of WPF or ASP.NET is assumed.

Examples include the Apache Software Foundation, the Eclipse Foundation, and the Gnome Foundation. There are many reasons why software development firms join and support a foundation. One common economic motivation is to save costs in the development of the software by spreading them over the participating parties. However, this is just the beginning. Beyond sharing costs, participating firms can increase their revenue through the provision and increased sale of complementary products. Also, by establishing a successful open source platform, software firms can compete more effectively across technology stacks and thereby increase their addressable market. Not to be neglected, community open source software is a common good, creating increased general welfare and hence goodwill for the involved companies.},

Es handelt sich dabei um das sogenannte „Multitouch Lab Journal“ – eine Anwendung, die für berührungsempfindliche Bildschirme konzipiert wurde. Die Arbeit ist in zwei Teile aufgeteilt. Im ersten theoretischen Teil werden die Grundlagen zum Laborbuch, zur Multitouch-Technologie sowie relevante Aspekte des Interface- und Interaktionsdesigns vorgestellt. Au\ss erdem wird der Nutzerzentrierte Gestaltungsprozess erl\"{a}utert, an dem sich diese Arbeit orientiert. In der darauf folgenden Nutzungskontextanalyse wird die Arbeit in einem biochemischen Labor untersucht. Daraus werden Anforderungen an das zu konzipierende System abgeleitet.

abstract = {Health care reform efforts, largely under the aegis of managed health care initiatives, have prompted clinical laboratories to increase efficiency and reduce both expenditures and test turnaround times. The adoption of newer technologies is viewed as a mechanism of achieving the latter objectives, but direct and indirect costs and outcomes are often difficult to project. Issues explored in this article include the impact on a large university hospital-based clinical microbiology laboratory following the application of various technological approaches to organism recognition and susceptibility testing and the consolidation of certain testing services. Included are applications of an automated blood culture system; radiometric detection, identification, and susceptibility testing of mycobacteria; and the use of molecular probes to identify various microorganisms. Assessment was made through retrospective review of direct costs, estimates of average test report turnaround times, work flow changes, and real or perceived outcomes. Both the application of technology per se and consolidation of an independent virology service into the general microbiology laboratory enabled improvement in test report times and led to direct or indirect cost reduction. Managerial strategies to bring about organization changes throughout all clinical laboratories in response to a major hospital-wide cost reduction program are also presented together with financial outcomes achieved.},

abstract = {Modern manufacturing facilities for bioproducts are highly automated with advanced process monitoring and data archiving systems. The time dynamics of hundreds of process parameters and outcome variables over a large number of production runs are archived in the data warehouse. This vast amount of data is a vital resource to comprehend the complex characteristics of bioprocesses and enhance production robustness. Cell culture process data from 108 'trains' comprising production as well as inoculum bioreactors from Genentech's manufacturing facility were investigated. Each run constitutes over one-hundred on-line and off-line temporal parameters. A kernel-based approach combined with a maximum margin-based support vector regression algorithm was used to integrate all the process parameters and develop predictive models for a key cell culture performance parameter. The model was also used to identify and rank process parameters according to their relevance in predicting process outcome. Evaluation of cell culture stage-specific models indicates that production performance can be reliably predicted days prior to harvest. Strong associations between several temporal parameters at various manufacturing stages and final process outcome were uncovered. This model-based data mining represents an important step forward in establishing a process data-driven knowledge discovery in bioprocesses. Implementation of this methodology on the manufacturing floor can facilitate a real-time decision making process and thereby improve the robustness of large scale bioprocesses.},

abstract = {What explains the experience of ‘‘being there’’ in a simulated or mediated environment? In recent years, research has pointed to various technological and psychological factors deemed important in eliciting this so-called experience of telepresence, including interactivity, sensory-motor integration, media trans- parency, and distal attribution. However, few theories exist that can combine these findings in a coherent framework. In the present paper, we formulate such a theoretical framework. We will argue that the experience of telepresence is a consequence of the way in which we are embodied, and that it extends naturally from the same ability that allows us to adjust to a slippery surface, or to the weight of a hammer. The importance of embodiment in the understanding of telepresence has been stated before, but these works have not yet fully addressed what it means to be embodied. We argue that ‘‘having a human body’’ means having a specific morphology, a body schema, and a body image. Subsequently we describe how tools and technological artifacts may be incorporated at each of these levels of embodi- ment, and the implications thereof for the experience of telepresence.},

In this article we present an overview of the studies which have demonstrated the induction of apoptosis during the cultivation of industrially important animal cell lines. We also discuss studies which have shown that deprivation of factors such as amino acids, glucose, serum and oxygen are potent inducers of apoptosis in industrial cultures. The suppression of apoptosis under these conditions has been demonstrated by a number of recent reports, and we describe ways in which this knowledge may be applied in the development of novel solutions to some of the technical problems associated with the development of successful large scale culture process.

abstract = {GAMP 4 is the most widely used, internationally accepted, guideline for validation of computer systems. Developed by ISPE's GAMP Forum technical subcommittee, GAMP 4 was most recently referenced in the FDA's Final Guidance on 21 CFR Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures. In addition, it was referenced in the PIC/S Guidance on "Good Practices for Computerized Systems in Regulated GXP Environments" and is being used as a training and reference resource for regulators worldwide. GAMP 4 is a significant advance on previous versions of this globally accepted guidance. The document has been considerably enhanced, restructured, and refined to reflect current regulatory expectations and good practice. More than 70 healthcare professionals, from the Americas and Europe, participated in the production of GAMP 4 by contributing to groups producing new and revising existing material. GAMP 4 is intended for suppliers and users in pharmaceutical manufacturing and related healthcare industries such as biotechnology and medical device. The Guide draws together key principles and practices and describes how they can be applied to determine the extent and scope of validation for different types of automated systems. GAMP 4 helps organizations develop: · validated and compliant automated systems using the concept of prospective validation following a life cycle model · procedures to ensure the automated system remains in a validated state once it is validated and in operation · Benefits of Using GAMP 4 · cost benefits-by aiding the production of systems that are fit for purpose, meet user and business requirements, and have acceptable operation and maintenance costs · better visibility of projects to ensure delivery on time, on budget, and to agreed quality standards · increased understanding of the subject and introduction of a common language and terminology · reductions in the cost and time taken to achieve compliant systems · improved compliance with regulatory expectation by defining a common and comprehensive life cycle model · clarification of the division of responsibility between user and supplier Now Available in French and German (Bound version only) Now Available on CD-ROM (English Only) GAMP 4 now is available on CD-ROM and includes all the benefits of GAMP 4 in a portable and easily searchable electronic format.

abstract = {De Gunst has formulated a stochastic model for the growth of a certain type of plant cell population that initially consists of n cells. The total cell number Nn(t) as predicted by the model is a non-Markovian counting process. The relative growth of the population, n-1(Nn(t) - n), converges almost surely uniformly to a nonrandom function X. In the present paper we investigate the behavior of the limit process X(t) as t tends to infinity and determine the order of magnitude of the duration of the process Nn(t). There are two possible causes for the process Nn to stop growing, and correspondingly, the limit process X(t) has a derivative X'(t) that is the product of two factors, one or both of which may tend to zero as t tends to infinity. It turns out that there is a remarkable discontinuity in the tail behavior of the processes. We find that if only one factor of X'(t) tends to zero, then the rate at which the limit process reaches its final limit is much faster and the order of magnitude of the duration ...},

Our computational study suggests that the proposed approach find effectively high quality schedules and competes successfully with alternative decomposition approaches such as Lagrangian relaxation.

abstract = {Executive Summary Business Process Management (BPM) has become a key focus for many companies, whether aimed at streamlining and automating critical processes, reducing costs or improvin g process effectiveness. The ability of BPM to bridge the divide between business communiti es and the IT systems runn ing business operations makes systems more agile and responsive to changing business needs, improves operational visibility which enables better governance and contro l, and opens the way to broader and deeper levels of business transformation and innovation. Lustratus has produced a number of co mpetitive reviews of different BPM o fferings, and this latest considers BPM offerings from a relatively young vendor, Appian, t ogether with two industry stalwarts in the shape of Oracle and IBM. Each company has ende d up with a different approach. Ap pian is a ‘pure play’ BPM vendor that has already experienced some considerable su ccess, while IBM and Oracle have a long history of integration and SOA software that has been augmented to deliver BPM functionality and solutions. Appian has targeted making teams of individuals more productive and efficient with so cial networking-bas ed collaborative BPM processes, while also allowing for expansion of these BPM projects into othe r areas. Oracle has been consistently updating its Fusion Mi ddleware platform to add BPM capabilities, but it has maintained a ‘bottom- up’ approach to BPM focused around the technology. IBM started from a technology position too, but has become committed to BPM as a driver of business value right from the top down, greatly reinforcing this commitment by shifting to a business-l ed approach to process optimization and transfor mation coupled with a large library of ‘packaged’ BPM solution templates fo r many industry and cross-industry process needs. But the difficulty for senior managers is that BPM can seem quite a complex area, with vendor presentations quickly dropping down into long and confusing lists of detailed technology argument s and functional checklists. What many managers are looking for is sufficient informat ion on the different vendor approaches to be able to get a feel for at least a priority list of potential suppliers. This assessment tries to satisfy this need, taking a high level look at the BPM functionality offered by each of these players and drawing out some of the main differences.},

Several systems biology consortia have started by focusing on standardization of cellular systems and experimental procedures.

abstract = {In this article, a flexible free and open-source software system for data logging and presentation will be described. The system is highly modular and adaptable and can be used in any laboratory in which continuous and/or ad hoc measurements require centralized storage. A presentation component for the data back end has furthermore been written that enables live visualization of data on any device capable of displaying Web pages. The system consists of three parts: data-logging clients, a data server, and a data presentation Web site. The logging of data from independent clients leads to high resilience to equipment failure, whereas the central storage of data dramatically eases backup and data exchange. The visualization front end allows direct monitoring of acquired data to see live progress of long-duration experiments. This enables the user to alter experimental conditions based on these data and to interfere with the experiment if needed. The data stored consist both of specific measurements and of continuously logged system parameters. The latter is crucial to a variety of automation and surveillance features, and three cases of such features are described: monitoring system health, getting status of long-duration experiments, and implementation of instant alarms in the event of failure.},

abstract = {Comprehensively describes all relevant state-of-the-art concepts, methods and technologies enabling process flexibility, e.g., process configuration, exception handling, ad-hoc process changes, process schema evolution, and many more Includes presentations of both open source and commercial process management systems; Enhanced by a website with ready-to-use slides, exercises and solutions, and further teaching material; Written by two of the most prominent researchers in the BPM area. In today’s dynamic business world, the success of a company increasingly depends on its ability to react to changes in its environment in a quick and flexible way. Companies have therefore identified process agility as a competitive advantage to address business trends like increasing product and service variability or faster time to market, and to ensure business IT alignment. Along this trend, a new generation of information systems has emerged—so-called process-aware information systems (PAIS), like workflow management systems, case handling tools, and service orchestration engines. With this book, Reichert and Weber address these flexibility needs and provide an overview of PAIS with a strong focus on methods and technologies fostering flexibility for all phases of the process lifecycle (i.e., modeling, configuration, execution and evolution). Their presentation is divided into six parts. Part I starts with an introduction of fundamental PAIS concepts and establishes the context of process flexibility in the light of practical scenarios. Part II focuses on flexibility support for pre-specified processes, the currently predominant paradigm in the field of business process management (BPM). Part III details flexibility support for loosely specified processes, which only partially specify the process model at build-time, while decisions regarding the exact specification of certain model parts are deferred to the run-time. Part IV deals with user- and data-driven processes, which aim at a tight integration of processes and data, and hence enable an increased flexibility compared to traditional PAIS. Part V introduces existing technologies and systems for the realization of a flexible PAIS. Finally, Part VI summarizes the main ideas of this book and gives an outlook on advanced flexibility issues. The book’s target groups include researchers, PhD students and Master students in the field of information systems. After reading the book, they will better understand PAIS flexibility aspects. To support the easy use as a textbook, a series of exercises is provided at the end of each chapter and slides and further teaching material are available on the book’s web site www.flexible-processes.com. Professionals specializing in business process management (BPM) who want to obtain a good understanding of flexibility challenges in BPM and state-of-the-art solutions will also benefit from the presentations of open source as well as commercial process management systems and related practical scenarios.},

The value and success of LIMSwiki (like any community wiki) is dependent upon the laboratory community contributing their vast knowledge through the creation of relevant articles and editing of existing articles where knowledge is absent. The explosion of the laboratory and health informatics fields paired with the vast number of LIMS vendors and products — as well as LIMS' increased scope well beyond its original purpose of sample management to just about all facets of laboratory operations — has resulted in a wealth of information not easily comprehended. This potential confusion frustrates informatics customers and makes the already challenging task of successfully implementing and managing a LIMS, ELN, or other informatics software even more difficult. It will be of great value to all in the community (including vendors, users, and consultants) to have a common vocabulary and understanding to facilitate communication, comparison, and product integration, providing maximum value to buyers and maximum opportunity to vendors and consultants.},

Interruptions can distract anesthesiologists from safety-critical tasks, such as the pretransfusion blood check. In a simulated operating room, 12 anesthesiologists requested blood as part of a "bleeding patient" scenario. They were distracted while their assistant accepted delivery of the product and began transfusing without performing the standard check. Anesthesiologists who immediately engaged with the interruption failed to notice the omission, whereas those who rejected or deferred the interruption all noted and remedied the omitted check (P < 0.05).

This information is prerequisite to the registration of multi-modal patient-specific data for enhancing the surgeon's navigation capabilities by observing beyond exposed tissue surfaces and for providing intelligent control of robotic-assisted instruments. In minimally invasive surgery (MIS), optical techniques are an increasingly attractive approach for in vivo 3D reconstruction of the soft-tissue surface geometry. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art methods for optical intra-operative 3D reconstruction in laparoscopic surgery and discusses the technical challenges and future perspectives towards clinical translation. With the recent paradigm shift of surgical practice towards MIS and new developments in 3D optical imaging, this is a timely discussion about technologies that could facilitate complex CAS procedures in dynamic and deformable anatomical regions.},

The book first discusses the theoretical foundations of multimedia data mining, presenting commonly used feature representation, knowledge representation, statistical learning, and soft computing techniques. It then provides application examples that showcase the great potential of multimedia data mining technologies. In this part, the authors show how to develop a semantic repository training method and a concept discovery method in an imagery database. They demonstrate how knowledge discovery helps achieve the goal of imagery annotation.The authors also describe an effective solution to large-scale video search, along with an application of audio data classification and categorization. This novel, self-contained book examines how the merging of multimedia and data mining research can promote the understanding and advance the development of knowledge discovery in multimedia data.},

The intent of ISO/IEC 19510:2013 is to standardize a business process model and notation in the face of many different modelling notations and viewpoints. In doing so, ISO/IEC 19510:2013 will provide a simple means of communicating process information to other business users, process implementers, customers, and suppliers.

abstract = {We present a tactile-rendering algorithm for simulating 3D geometric features, such as bumps, on touch screen surfac- es. This is achieved by modulating friction forces between the user’s finger and the touch screen, instead of physically moving the touch surface. We proposed that the percept of a 3D bump is created when local gradients of the rendered virtual surface are mapped to lateral friction forces. To val- idate this approach, we first establish a psychophysical model that relates the perceived friction force to the con- trolled voltage applied to the tactile feedback device. We then use this model to demonstrate that participants are three times more likely to prefer gradient force profiles than other commonly used rendering profiles. Finally, we present a generalized algorithm and conclude the paper with a set of applications using our tactile rendering technology.},

In addition to these basics, modern laboratories need software that can run multiple different protocols in parallel and that can be easily extended to interface with a constantly growing diversity of techniques and instruments. We present Clarity, a laboratory automation manager that is hardware agnostic, portable, extensible, and open source. Clarity provides critical features including remote monitoring, robust error reporting by phone or email, and full state recovery in the event of a system crash. We discuss the basic organization of Clarity, demonstrate an example of its implementation for the automated analysis of bacterial growth, and describe how the program can be extended to manage new hardware. Clarity is mature, well documented, actively developed, written in C\# for the Common Language Infrastructure, and is free and open-source software. These advantages set Clarity apart from currently available laboratory automation programs. The source code and documentation for Clarity is available at http://code.google.com/p/osla/.},

abstract = {This document provides a set of high-level guidelines, methods and recommendations to migrate network service from a traditional network, i.e. the starting network, to a Software- Defined Network (SDN) based on the OpenFlow™ Standard, i.e. the target network. Traditional networks in scope include WAN/service provider/carrier networks, datacenter networks, enterprise networks and campus networks with diverse use cases. This document describes a framework for migration methods exemplified by a set of target networks. This framework includes the description of target network core requirements, starting network migration requirements, phased migration requirements, and finally validation requirements to ensure a complete and successful network migration. The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Sections 2, 3 and 4 describe real-world examples of OpenFlow-based SDN migration use cases and deployments covering different network domains. These examples are: Google Inter- Datacenter WAN, NTT Provider Edge, and Stanford Campus Network use cases. Section 5 provides an overview of the scope and objectives of the ONF Migration Working Group’s charter, and defines a terminology and a structure for SDN migration use cases. Section 6 summarizes best practices and lessons learned from the migration use cases and approaches covered in this document. Section 7 provides a brief conclusion with suggestions for future work. This is a living document that will continue to adopt new use cases and document the migration requirements defined within the ONF Migration Working Group’s charter. Each use case shall document a list of characteristics described in Appendix A. Appendix B provides a list of references for further reading.},

abstract = {DH23A cells, an alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-resistant variant of rat hepatoma tissue culture cells (HTC), contain high levels of very stable ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). In the absence of DFMO, the high ODC activity results in a large accumulation of endogenous putrescine. Concomitant with the putrescine increase is a period of cytostasis and a subsequent loss of viable cells. In contrast, HTC cells with a moderate polyamine content can be maintained in exponential growth. This suggests that a moderate polyamine concentration is necessary for both optimal cell growth and survival. The cytotoxicity observed in the DH23A cells is apparently not due to byproducts of polyamine oxidation or alterations in steady state intracellular pH or free [Ca2+]. It is possible to mimic the effects of high levels of stable ODC by treatment of cells with exogenous putrescine in the presence of DFMO. This suggests that overaccumulation of putrescine is the causative agent in the observed cytotoxicity, although the mechanism is unclear. These data support the hypothesis that downregulation of ODC may be necessary to prevent accumulation of cytotoxic concentrations of the polyamines.},

abstract = {The resident scheduling problem is a specific case of the multiperiod staff assignment problem where individuals are assigned to a variety of tasks over multiple time periods. As in many staffing and training situations, numerous limitations and requirements may be placed on those assignments. This paper presents a procedure for addressing two major problems inherent in the determination of a solution to this type of problem: infeasibilities that naturally occur in the scheduling environment but are obscured by complexity; and the intractable nature of large-scale models with this structure. The procedure developed describes a systematic approach that allows decision makers to resolve system-inherent infeasibilities, and a heuristic based on rounding to develop good feasible solutions to the model. The procedure is illustrated via a case example of resident assignments for teaching and training modules in a university affiliated teaching hospital.},

We also experienced three major events that taught us that total laboratory systems are not always effective: these were an earthquake, a nerve gas attack, and an outbreak of food poisoning. Political changes in the national health care system in Japan have forced the cutting of expenses for laboratory testing. In this context, cost-effective laboratory testing has been considered, and many hospitals have replaced total laboratory systems with small laboratory systems. Our University Hospital introduced a mini-lab system consisting of compact instruments to increase laboratory efficiency, and we have begun point-of-care testing education for medical students. This combination enables rapid and convenient testing, and is responsive to the political changes in the Japanese health care system.},

The relationship of actual process planning and the elements of GSPN were studied. Workflow engine as the core of the whole workflow system supplied the system execution environment, so the design and implementation is the key of the system. The design method and development flow of workflow engine were discussed based on JBOSS JBPM.
